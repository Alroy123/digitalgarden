### _The Coming of  Three_

> _“Before the first flame, before the first song, there was the Void.  
> And the Void was hungry.”_

---

### **The Wasteland Before Light**

In the beginning, there was no sun, no sea, no sky.  
Only the **Great Wasteland**, a plane of unending shadow — choked by storms of **negative energy**, where creation itself recoiled in pain.

Across that shattered realm roamed the **Firstborn of Ruin** — **dragons of void and flame**, beings of immense hunger, whose breath turned mountains to dust and rivers to poison.  
They ruled the wastes in endless fury, and above them all rose their lord:

> **Agnoxaline**, _The World Eater_,  
> whose scales were shards of night, whose heart burned with the hate of creation itself.*

He devoured all that dared to be.  
When the dragons’ endless war ceased, it was only because there was nothing left to destroy.

The Void belonged to him,  
and in the Void, nothing could hope to live.

### **The Coming of the Prime Three**

Then — in the silence after ruin — came a tremor.  
A whisper.  
A _breath._

From the veil between worlds, **three great beings** emerged, drawn by the cries of a universe dying unborn.

- **Lathander**, the _Morninglord_, light incarnate, whose laughter broke the silence.
    
- **Camorin**, the _Tear of Creation_, whose sorrow shaped compassion and fate.
    
- **Duimorka**, the _Keeper of Eternity_, keeper of endings, who carried death as a mercy, not a curse.
    

They gazed upon the void and saw potential buried in pain.  
Where Agnoxaline had brought emptiness, they saw a place that _might yet breathe_.

Lathander raised his hand, and light burst across the nothing — a **first sunrise** upon a world that had never seen one.  
Camorin wept at the beauty of it, and her tears became **water**, flowing into rivers that cut through the black sands.  
Duimorka planted his scythe into the ground, and from its shadow sprang **roots**, the first trees, to anchor the fragile world.

But the dragons of the old world would not bow to the light.  
They rose in defiance, scales gleaming like obsidian fire.  
Agnoxaline himself stirred, his roar shaking the heavens:

> _“You cannot unmake what I have devoured!”_

---

### **The War of Flame and Light**

The Prime Three called upon allies to stand with them — the **Giants**, sculpted from clay and sky, the first mortals to draw divine breath.  
And from among the dragons themselves, a few turned away from ruin, siding with light and life.  
They became the **Dragons of Dawn**, their scales shimmering gold, silver, and bronze — the first to embrace creation.

For a thousand ages the heavens burned.  
Lightning met flame, shadow devoured light, and the oceans boiled.  
Giants fell in heaps, turning to stone where they died, forming the first mountains.  
Dragons screamed as their wings were torn from them, their bones becoming veins of ore deep within the earth.

At last, the Prime Three faced Agnoxaline upon the edge of all existence.  
The World Eater’s breath consumed stars; his tail broke continents.  
But Lathander shone brighter than the void, his light piercing the dragon’s heart.  
Camorin’s tears quenched the flame within him, softening his rage.  
And Duimorka spoke a single word of ending — a death that even eternity obeyed.

With that word, the World Eater fell, his titanic body crashing into the heart of the world.  
Where he defeated but not destroyed, for can you truly destroy nothing itself. His **heart crystalized into pure negative essence**, a wound in the world that would never truly heal — the **Abyssal Scar**, where darkness still whispers.

---

### **The First Dawn**

When the storm cleared, silence returned — but not the empty silence from before.  
This silence was peaceful. Expectant.  
The kind that comes _before_ a sunrise, not after an ending.

Lathander looked upon what they had wrought and smiled.

> _“Let there be morning,”_ he said, _“for even the longest night must break.”_

Camorin, weary yet content, took his hand, her tears falling as dew upon the newborn grass.  
Duimorka turned away, his duty fulfilled, for every dawn must one day set.

Thus the **The First Light** was born —  
and from that light, the first songs of creation echoed across the newborn world.  
The Giants built their cities among the mountains, the dragons took to the skies, and the gods began to weave life and law, shaping **Camerinthious** into a realm of beauty and danger.

But the heart of Agnoxaline still beat faintly beneath the surface,  
a dark promise that even the light must cast a shadow.

> but in the fragile hope of morning.  
> Yet the dawn is only beautiful  
> because night still waits to return.”_
