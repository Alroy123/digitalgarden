### _Of Love, Creation, and the Fall of the Morninglord_

> _“From light was born life,  
> and from life was born love.  
> And love, unchecked, can burn brighter than any sun —  
> and destroy just as completely.”_

### **The Loneliness of the Morninglord**

The Age of Peace had endured a thousand generations.  
The Prime Three had shaped the heavens and mortals in harmony, and all creation sang their praises.

Yet in the heart of **Lathander**, the Morninglord, there stirred a quiet longing.  
He had built the dawn, shaped the soul, and filled the world with beauty —  
but creation without discovery had grown stale.

The mortals he made loved, laughed, and suffered with passion he could not feel.  
He looked upon them as a father — yet somewhere in his radiant heart, a forbidden envy bloomed.  
He wished to **understand** them — to feel as they felt, to love as they loved.

And so he descended.

### **The Mortal Who Stole the Heart of a God**

Among the mortals of the first dawn lived a woman named **Koramia**.  
Her beauty was said to still the winds; her laughter was the sound of the sweetest song ever sung.  
But more than beauty, she possessed _curiosity_ — a heart that questioned the heavens.
Lathander in mortal form found Koramia, and was enthralled by her beauty and her very heart. 
Koramia saw Lathander not as a god to be worshiped but a kind soul, that just wants love. 
They stayed up all night talking of the world, of life and of love. 

One night, as the stars burned bright over the plains of Camerinthious, she felt a warmth descend —  
and before her stood a man of light, cloaked in morning. And she saw Lathander for his true self for the first time.

> _“You have called my name in your heart, though you did not know it,”_ he said.  
> _“I am Lathander.”_

Koramia knelt, trembling, but the god lifted her chin.

> _“Do not bow to me, mortal. Tonight, I walk not as a god, but as a man.”_

And under the silver sky, god and mortal spoke — of life, of love, of what it meant to be _alive_.  
Night after night he returned, leaving the heavens behind to sit beside her,  
his laughter mingling with hers in the meadows of the world he had made.

Each visit, he grew less divine and more human.  
And in her eyes, he saw a reflection of the life he had never truly lived.

When at last they lay together, the stars themselves dimmed their gaze.  
For even the heavens knew a boundary had been crossed.

### **The Goddess of Love is Born**

Months passed.  
Koramia awoke one morning with light stirring within her womb —  
not pain, but warmth, like the first dawn.

She wept with fear and wonder.  
When Lathander returned, she cried out,

> _“You are my god! What child could I bear but ruin?”_

But the Morninglord smiled, his eyes alight with pride.

> _“Not ruin, Koramia. Creation. You are the greatest of my works.”_

The child she carried would be named **Bellala**,  
whose birth would awaken the arcane — the power of mortal will shaped into magic.

Thus from love came wonder.  
But even divine joy casts a shadow.

### **The Weeping Mother’s Sorrow**

Far above, in the golden halls of the Prime,  
**Camorin** — wife of Lathander, mother of his divine children — felt the tear before she saw it.

When she learned the truth, her grief shook the heavens.  
She tore her eyes from her face, for she could not bear to see the world her husband had defiled with betrayal.  
Her endless weeping flooded the lands, forming new seas.

The gods named her **The Weeping Mother**, and from that day, she no longer spoke her true name.  
Her tears gave birth to sorrow itself — a gift and a curse to mortals,  
for only those who grieve can truly understand love.

---

### **The Wrath of Blood**

Not all her children mourned quietly.  
Among them, **Chakar**, the God of Murder, felt his mother’s anguish as his own.  
His heart burned like iron, his hands ached for vengeance.

He descended upon the mortal realm in a cloak of shadow, hunting the woman who had stolen his father’s heart.  
He found **Koramia** in her garden, her belly heavy with divine life.

> _“For my mother’s pain, your blood shall be the offering,”_ he whispered.

But before his blade could strike, the air filled with light —  
Lathander himself appeared, his radiance burning through the night.  
He seized his son by the throat and cast him into darkness, his fury shaking the stars.

> _“You would murder love itself?”_ the Morninglord cried.  
> _“Then live forever in the shadow of it.”_

And Chakar fled, becoming a specter of slaughter and hatred, forever cursed to kill in the dark.

### **The Vow of the Morninglord**

When it was over, Lathander knelt beside his beloved.  
She was unharmed, but her tears stained the light upon his face.

He looked up at the heavens — at Camorin’s endless weeping, at the silence of Duimorka,  
at the rift his love had carved across creation.

And he wept.  
For the first time since the dawn, the Morninglord wept.

> _“What light can I offer a world I have burned?”_ he said.  
> _“It is on this day I swear I shall never walk among mortals again.”_

He raised his hand, swearing the **Vow of the Morninglord** —  
never again would he take a mortal form, never again would he tread upon the world he had once loved.

But before he withdrew from the realm, he touched Koramia’s heart and their unborn child.

> _“You are divine now,”_ he whispered. _“May your love heal what mine has broken.”_

And with that vow, **Koramia** — once mortal — was ascended to divinity.  
She became the **Goddess of Love and Beauty**, radiant beyond compare,  
for she was born not of divine essence, but of _affection itself._
And with that, he ascended them both —  
Koramia, the first mortal made god,  
and Bellala, goddess of magic and wonder.

### **The Mortals Flame **

Thus, love became a fire — one that gave light to all creation,  
but left the heavens scorched.

Camorin, in her grief, turned from her divine kin to guide mortal souls.  
Duimorka fell silent, watching love and loss entwine across eternity.  
Lathander withdrew, his light dimmed to a sorrowful glow.  
And from their pain, mortals learned passion — that joy and tragedy are the same flame,  
burning brightest just before it consumes.

> The Mortals Flame,  
> where love touched the divine,  
> and the divine learned to suffer.”_
