### _Of Love, Creation, and the Seeds of Jealousy_

> _“In the stillness after the first dawn, the world was young, and the gods were untested.  
> It was an age of beauty, and of beginnings — when even perfection dared to dream.”_

### **The Breath of Life**

When the war against Agnoxaline ended, the world lay new and trembling beneath the light of the gods.  
The wounds of battle cooled, and from those wounds came possibility.

Upon the mountains where the Giants slept, grass began to grow.  
Upon the plains where the dragons fell, forests took root.  
And upon the seas born of Camorin’s tears, the first waves sang songs of peace.

Lathander beheld this and felt a joy so pure that it became unbearable.

> _“Creation must not be still,”_ he said. _“It must ever rise, ever change, ever live.”_

So he took from his light a single ember, from Camorin’s tears a single drop, and from Duimorka’s shadow a single breath — and from these he formed **mortals**, the first true children of life.

They were small and fragile — not of mountain like the Giants, nor of flame like the dragons — but of **soul**.  
And in that fragility, there was greatness.  
For even when they fell, they could rise again.

Camorin watched the mortals live, love, and die — their fates weaving together like threads across the loom of the world — and she smiled through her tears.

> _“Let their journeys never end,”_ she said. _“Let each ending be a new beginning.”_

Duimorka, silent as always, knelt beside the graves of the first fallen and spoke a word that lifted their souls beyond.  
Thus he created the **The Divine Beyond**, a place where no soul would ever truly be lost.

And the three gods — together — became known as the **Prime Three**, the shapers of all that was and ever would be.

### **The Birth of the Divine Children**

In time, Lathander and Camorin’s love shone so brightly that the heavens themselves bore witness.  
And from that love were born the **Children of the Dawn** — eight divine offspring who would each carry a spark of their parents’ power.

First came **Quellana**, the _Wild Empress_, born amidst a bloom of flowers and storms.  
Her laughter gave rise to the beasts of the world, her breathe fed the forests, and her joy stirred the winds.  
She was the pulse of nature, unrestrained and glorious.

Then came **Cyborus**, the _Absolute Law_, born with a third eye that beheld the true law of the cosmos.  
He spoke rarely, for he saw all that was, all that could be, and all that must never come to pass.  
His voice was the law that bound creation in harmony.

Next was **Ilmater**, gentle and kind — the _One Who Endures_.  
He took upon himself the suffering of the weak, offering solace to those in pain.  
From his touch came compassion, from his voice came mercy.

**Persana** and **Umberlee**, the divine twins, were born together upon the crest of the first wave.  
Persana commanded the calm seas and the justice of the tide,  
while Umberlee roared with the fury of storms and the passion of chaos.  
They were the sea itself — serene and violent, loving and cruel.

**Rijen**  _The Great Deceivers_ came into being in shadow, her eyes gleaming with secrets.  
She was the whisper between truths, the question between words.  
Where there was peace, she sowed curiosity.  
Where there was love, she tested its strength.

Then **Tyrgul**, _The Whispered Dark_ dark and quiet, his eyes pale with fear and longing.  
He knew too well the silence that lives in every heart — the tremor before disaster, the panic before acceptance.  
He would become the echo of terror that gives courage its meaning.

And lastly, **Chakar**, _The Everlasting Hunger_ whose first cry split the heavens.  
His blood was flame, his heart a void.  
He found beauty only in destruction, and so he became the God of Murder — the shadow none could escape.

Thus were born the eight children of light and sorrow,  
and the world trembled with the power of their arrival.

### **The Keeper’s Gift**

Duimorka, their uncle, watched this family from afar.  
He was proud — though his face never showed it.  
He gifted each of the divine children a single truth:

> _“Even gods must die one day.  
> But in every ending, there is a new dawn.  
> Remember this, and you will never lose yourselves.”_

Yet one among them — **Rijen** — heard those words and smiled a knowing smile.  
She saw in her uncle’s stoic gaze a loneliness that even gods could not bear.  
And in that loneliness, a weakness she could use.

---

### **The Age of Peace**

For an age, harmony reigned.  
The gods ruled their domains with joy:

- Quellana’s forests grew thick and wild.
    
- Persana’s seas whispered songs of calm.
    
- Cyborus weighed law and order with divine precision.
    
- Ilmater walked among mortals, easing their pain.
    

Even Umberlee’s storms were a dance, fierce but beautiful.  
And Lathander, proud father and creator, looked upon them all and said,

> _“Behold, the First Heaven.  
> May it last forever.”_

But even as he spoke, the seeds of betrayal had begun to root.  
For perfection cannot exist without envy, and peace cannot exist without shadow.

Rijen’s laughter echoed in the dark corners of paradise,  
and Duimorka’s heart — untouched by joy — began to ache for something he could not name.

> the Age of Light, when even gods believed in forever.  
> But forever is the cruelest lie of all.”_
