**History of Dalerrin**

  

**The Collision:**

350 years ago from the start of the campaign was the cataclysmic event known as The Collision. This event was when the Feywild, Shadowfell and Material Plane smashed together into one, sending Fey and Shadowfell magic everywhere. 

  

**The Downfall of Idris:**

Idris, the kingdom that was first to defend against Guildaxe’s monsters. They were a safe haven for those who could make it. Using arcane and some deals with demons. After The Collision some of the trapped demons were set free and that led to the fall of a once great kingdom. 

  

**The 50 Year War:**

This was a war that lasted 50 years, it was between the rest of Guildaxes forces and the remaining Kingdom of Idris and the rising Empire of Luminous. 

  

**After the War:**

After the war the Realm Dalirren began to change into what we know at the start of the campaign. 300 years of peace began, during the years of peace the city of Antilla was built. 

  

**The Three Siblings:**

Over 300,000 years ago there were 3 siblings, Shallima, Guildaxes and Siverilla. They lived thousands of years in the fey realm doing as they please whenever they please, then the first people of the material plane visited the fey. Siverilla fell in love with the mortals but Guildaxes despised them believing them to be an inferior kind, and that now both his sisters became infatuated by these mortals. Shallima took an interest in the lives of one specific mortal and made a pact with them and began to meddle in their life. 

  

Finding out that there is mortality in other realms really freaked Guildaxe out so he went looking to insure his family's immortality. He found an ancient fey ritual to separate one's body and soul and convinced his sisters to do so with him. One of the things they would need was to attach their soul to an object with great meaning to them. Guildaxe chose the things he hated the most: a mortal. Shallima chose an amulet that was very dear to her, a red Ruby inset in an ornate black metal amulet. Siverilla brought a rare feywild flower. As the ritual ends the souls of the three siblings are lifted out of their bodies and newly inhabit the things that the siblings brought. 

After they separated their souls from their bodies they began to change gradually over hundreds of years. Their attitudes towards life became further dissociated, even some of the feelings they rarely used began to leave them entirely. 
Thousands of years go by more mortals enter the feywild and now the siblings begin to interject themselves into the material plane. 
It got to a point where Guildaxes would send large Shadowfell monsters to destroy the growing cities of the world, setting the mortals back hundreds of years. And Shallima was toying with the lives of many of the mortals just for fun. Siverilla's heart was breaking for the mortals, she hated to see them suffer for little success so she did the only thing she thought she could contain and control her siblings. She engaged in an ancient ritual that was as old as time itself, this ritual would use the energy holding the planes apart to encase her brother and sister forever. She had to give up everything she loved for the success of the mortal world, she gave up her home and her family. So she did, and thus created the event in history known as The Collision. After the feywild, Shadowfell and the material plane all collided together. There was a time of chaos and uncertainty (this is when Idris fell), then a 300 year war broke out between the darkness of the Shadowfell and the mortals. After the 50 Year War, Siverilla then helped to build an empire to rule over so something like this would never happen again. For 300 years she has rained.

Thus rose the Candescents Queen, and the Luminous Empire.
