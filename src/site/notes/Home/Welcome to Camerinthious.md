In a world where the Feywild, Shadowfell and the Material planes have merged into one there is a dark shadow on the horizon. From the great acers of the Emerald Forest, where the natural woods of the forest turned into crystalized versions of itself to the Black sands dunes of the Ravens Dessert to the Far reaches of the fallen realms of Idris, a once great empire of the old world. To the beacon of the new world, the great floating city of Ascensia, home of the Luminous Empire.
