**Gods of Good**

**Lathander**
His was the first of the Prime three Deities that have life to the realm as we know it. With a vast portfolio including birth, renewal, spring and youth, as well as athletics, self-perfection, vitality and creativity. **The Morninglord** was symbolized by the rising sun, but rather than being the god of the sun itself, he was the god of dawn, which represented the potential of a new day. A god of hope and light, Lathander's name was invoked at the start of new endeavors, whether sealing a new deal, or setting out on a new journey.

Despite being among the oldest of Camerinthious's gods, Lathander nonetheless retained the cheery hopefulness of youth. His was an eternal optimist, with a constant willingness to focus on hopes for the future rather than wallow in the failures of the present. He was a righteously determined god who encouraged all to bath in the glory and freedom of his light, to help aid all of his creations to live life to its brightest and fullest. Exuberant and friendly, his interests laid in vibrant life (regarding both birth and nature) and conversely urged the destruction of the corrupted mockeries of life that he saw the Undead. 

Though most know Lathander as the radiant bringer of dawn—lord of light, life, and creation—few remember that even the Morninglord once cast a shadow. In his younger years, when the gods still shaped the world with their hands, Lathander often spoke of what he called his _“darkness”_—a hunger for beauty and vitality so fierce that it sometimes outshone his better nature.

In those days, he was wedded to **Camorin, The Weeping Mother**, a goddess of compassion, new beginnings and renewal. Together they nurtured the first blossoms of mortal life, tending to the fragile world like gardeners of the soul. But as the mortals grew and flourished, Lathander’s fascination with them deepened into something more dangerous. Their fleeting lives and passionate hearts stirred him in ways even the endless dawn could not.

Among them was **Koramia**, a mortal woman whose spirit shone brighter than the sunrise itself. Lathander saw in her the perfection of mortal grace, and in a moment of divine folly, he descended to the mortal realm to be with her. Though he knew it betrayed his vow to Camorin, his love—and his lust—for Koramia overwhelmed his reason.

From their union, a child was conceived—a being neither mortal nor divine, destined to embody both dawn and dusk. When the weight of his actions settled upon him, Lathander was overcome with remorse. He had wounded his divine bride and defied the sacred balance. To atone, he vowed never again to walk the mortal realm in physical form.

Yet before his departure, he bestowed upon Koramia and their unborn child the spark of divinity, raising them to godhood so that neither would suffer the mortal fate he had cursed them with.

**Duimorka** 
In the age before memory, when the heavens were still molten with creation’s fire, three divine beings shaped the world of **Camerinthious**—**Lathander, Camorin**, and **Duimorka**, known together as the **Prime Three**.

Lathander gave light and warmth. Camorin nurtured compassion and growth. But it was Duimorka who gave form to endings—who ensured that all things, no matter how radiant, would one day fade.

When the three created mortals, Duimorka was struck by their fragility. He saw how quickly their lives flickered and died, like sparks swallowed by the night. His divine heart, vast yet empty, ached for them. In that sorrow, he made a choice that would forever change the fate of mortal souls.
Where others saw death as a final darkness, Duimorka saw the potential for **renewal**. Rather than curse mortals with eternal nothingness, he used his divine essence to open a passage—a bridge between mortal life and the divine realm. Thus he gave mortals the gift of **eternity**, a chance to be reborn among the gods, to begin again beyond the veil.

For this, the mortals called him **The Keeper**—god of **new beginnings and endless life**, guardian of souls, and watcher of the eternal flame. For, as he once said, _“What is eternity, if it is not shared?”_

Yet even the Keeper was not without flaw. Though eternal, Duimorka was not immune to emptiness. His divine purpose dulled his heart; he rarely felt emotion, and when he did, it came like thunder. Mortals and gods alike feared his judgments, for he was the one who marked those whose time had come—and his choices often seemed cold, detached, and cruel.

But then came **Rijen**, the daughter of his brother Lathander and the Goddess of **Lies and Deception**. She was radiant in her cunning, a weaver of truths so twisted they became beautiful. To Duimorka, she was the first spark of true emotion he had felt since the dawn of time. He knew his desire for her was forbidden, but the stillness within him stirred to life whenever she was near.
At last, he resolved to confront her—to bare his truth, whatever her answer might be. To his astonishment, Rijen confessed she felt the same. Their love became a secret flame, hidden in the folds of eternity. For centuries they met in silence, their union veiled from divine eyes.
But secrets among gods are never kept forever. When their affair was discovered, whispers reached Lathander—that Duimorka had forced himself upon Rijen, and that she now carried his child.
Betrayal ignited the heavens. Lathander’s wrath burned brighter than the dawn, and thus began the **Divine War**, a conflict that shattered the unity of the Prime Three. Worlds trembled, and countless divine hosts fell, their light extinguished in a storm of divine rage.
Only in the aftermath, when silence once again reigned over Camerinthious, did the truth unravel. Rijen had deceived them all. Her love had been a fabrication—a web of lies spun for her own ends. It was she who had whispered falsehoods to Lathander, turning brother against brother, father against lover.
Duimorka, broken by grief and betrayal, withdrew from the affairs of gods and mortals alike. He returned to his silent dominion, tending to the souls of the dead, his once-gentle hand now heavy with sorrow.

**The Weeping Mother** (Camorin) 
In the first dawn of creation, when the divine still walked among the stars, **Camorin** was one of the **Prime Three**, alongside her beloved **Lathander** and the steadfast **Duimorka**. Together they shaped the world that Lathander, in his devotion, named **Camerinthious** after Camorin herself—a world born of love, light, and promise.

Lathander breathed life into the first mortals. Duimorka gave them eternity when their brief lives came to an end. But it was Camorin who nurtured and guided them through the in-between—the fragile, uncertain moments that defined their mortal journey.

For she was the **Goddess of Change, Fate, and the Journey to New Destinations**. Where Lathander brought beginnings and Duimorka oversaw endings, Camorin tended to everything that lived _between_—growth, transformation, and the ever-turning wheel of destiny.
She was mother to all life, divine and mortal alike. Her compassion was boundless; her tears watered the first forests, and her laughter filled the rivers. Under her gaze, the world flourished, and the Prime Three stood united in purpose and love.

But harmony, like all things, is fragile.

When the truth of Lathander’s affair with the mortal Koramia came to light, Camorin’s heart broke. The light of her joy dimmed, and her tears began to fall—first for her husband’s betrayal, then for the world they had made together. She could not bear to look upon the creation that had once been her pride. In her grief, she tore out her own eyes, saying that she no longer wished to see what beauty and sorrow had become of her love.

Yet even blinded, she **could not stop weeping**. Her tears became endless, flowing through the mortal realm as rain, rivers, and seas. It was said that every drop of water in Camerinthious carries a fragment of the Weeping Mother’s sorrow.

From that day, few dared to speak her true name. She herself abandoned it, allowing mortals and gods alike to call her only **The Weeping Mother**.

When the **Divine War** tore apart the heavens, Camorin refused to take sides. While gods turned upon each other and their divine fire scorched the skies, she turned her back on their wrath and walked among the mortals. As the world burned with divine fury, she **shielded humankind**, gathering their lost and frightened souls, guiding them safely through the ruin.

After the war, when silence returned to the heavens, the other gods shunned her. Some claimed she had betrayed her kind by aiding mortals instead of standing with her divine kin. So she chose exile willingly, descending fully into the mortal realm. There, she took upon herself the sacred duty of **guiding souls from mortality to divinity**, ensuring every spirit reached its destined end in peace.

Centuries have passed since then. The world remembers her as **The Weeping Mother**, the eternal mourner who wanders unseen among the dying, whispering comfort in their final moments. Her tears still fall, though softer now—like gentle rain upon the graves of those she loves.

And though her heart was once shattered by betrayal, whispers among the faithful say that, on rare nights when the stars burn low and dawn has not yet come, Camorin and Lathander speak again. Their words are quiet, their meetings brief, but the love between them—wounded, distant, eternal—still endures.

For even in grief, **The Weeping Mother cannot stop loving**.

**The Wild Empress** 
Born first among the divine children of **Lathander** and **Camorin**, **Quellana** inherited both her father’s creative flame and her mother’s nurturing heart. From the moment her eyes opened upon Camerinthious, she saw the beauty of wildness—the untamed pulse of life that existed beyond order or restraint.
She became known as **The Wild Empress**, goddess of **Nature and the Chaos it Brings**. Where others saw beauty in harmony and symmetry, Quellana found joy in the unpredictable rhythm of creation—the storm that tears down a forest so new growth may rise, the predator’s hunt that keeps balance in the circle of life. To her, chaos was not destruction, but the heartbeat of existence itself.
Quellana loved to shape creatures of all kinds, from the smallest crawling things to beasts of thunder and scale. Though she lacked her father’s divine gift to breathe _souls_ into her creations, it never dimmed her passion. She poured her essence into every living thing, giving them instinct and spirit in place of divine flame. And though her creatures could not speak prayers or bear worship, they loved her in their own way—through song, through growth, through survival. She was even able to gift the power of nature to some of her fathers creations.

Unlike many of her kin, Quellana never felt at home in the shining halls of divinity. The heavens were too still, too clean, too quiet. She preferred the whisper of leaves, the crash of waves, the wind’s wild voice upon mountain peaks. Mortals said she could often be seen wandering the deepest forests or walking barefoot across storm-wracked cliffs, feeding the beasts with her own divine hand, her laughter carried on the wind.

When the **Divine War** broke the heavens, Quellana stood beside her father, **Lathander**, against the forces of her uncle **Duimorka** and her younger sister **Rijen**, the goddess of Lies and Deception. She fought not for glory, but for balance—for she believed that unchecked chaos among the gods would destroy the world she loved.
It was Quellana who **discovered the truth** of Rijen’s deception—that her affair with Duimorka was no violation, but a lie crafted to sow discord between the brothers. It was she who carried that truth to her father, begging him not to let his light be consumed by rage. Through her compassion and courage, Lathander’s wrath was stayed, and the war’s fires began to fade.

After the Divine War, Lathander named Quellana his **right hand**—his most trusted guide and protector of all living things. Together, their powers intertwined: his light nourished her forests and fields, and her wildness reminded his light to grow rather than burn.

Yet even as she stands beside her father, Quellana remains a **creature of freedom**. She is worshipped not in temples, but in glades and mountaintops. Her followers—druids, rangers, shapeshifters, and wild mages—say that she walks among them still, a whisper in the wind or a gleam in a wolf’s eye.

They pray not for peace, but for balance—for they know the Wild Empress loves both the bloom and the storm.





**Koramia**
Goddess of Love, Beauty, and Passion, Before her ascension, Koramia was but a mortal woman—yet even then, her beauty was said to rival the dawn itself. Her hair gleamed like sunlight on still water, and her laughter could still the hearts of all who heard it. Men and women alike were drawn to her, for her allure was not only in her face or form, but in the warmth and gentleness that radiated from her soul.

The scholars of old called her _“the mortal who stole the heart of a god.”_

For one day, wandering through golden meadows, Koramia met a stranger whose light seemed to come from within. His words were kind, his smile radiant, and his presence made the air itself shimmer. She did not know then that he was **Lathander**, the Morninglord—the god of light, creation, and renewal.
Their bond grew in secret. Night after night, they met beneath the stars, speaking of life, love, and the world he had shaped. To her, he was not a god but a companion—gentle, curious, full of wonder for his own creation. And to him, she was something he had never known: _love unbound by divinity._
When they at last lay together, their union was not of mortal and god, but of equals—two souls in perfect harmony.

Months passed before Koramia realized she was with child. Fear took root in her heart, for she had heard tales of gods who abandoned their mortal lovers, leaving them to suffer the scorn of heaven. When she told Lathander, she trembled, expecting anger or indifference.

Instead, he wept with joy. He spoke of her as his greatest creation, and of their child as the proof that love itself could transcend the boundaries of divinity.

But joy cannot remain untouched by consequence.

When **Camorin**, Lathander’s divine wife, learned of the affair, her grief shook the world. Her tears became rivers and seas; her sorrow blotted out the sun. In her anguish, thus she became **The Weeping Mother**.

In the wake of Camorin’s despair, vengeance stirred. **Chakar**, Lathander’s son and the god of Murder, came to Koramia in secret, blade in hand, intending to slay her in his mother’s name. But Lathander intervened, saving her just before death’s hand could reach her.

Shaken by the ruin his passion had caused, Lathander vowed never again to take physical form or walk upon the mortal world. To protect Koramia and their unborn child, he pleaded with his brother **Duimorka**, the Keeper of Eternity, to help him raise her beyond mortality. Together, they **ascended Koramia to godhood**, making her the first and only mortal to join the divine as one of their own.

Thus was born **Koramia, the Goddess of Love and Beauty**, radiant and immortal.

Yet even among the gods, her heart remained gentle and human. Though she lived in divine splendor, she could never forget that her existence was born of both love and sorrow. To distract herself from her guilt—knowing she was the spark that led to Camorin’s endless weeping—she used her divine gifts to **bless mortals with beauty, compassion, and the courage to love freely.** Her touch became the muse of artists, the fire in lovers’ hearts, the grace that softened even the cruelest soul.

In time, she gave birth to a daughter, **Bellala**, goddess of **magical creatures**, whose light and laughter embodied the wonder of both her parents.

When the **Divine War** erupted, Koramia stood beside Lathander and her stepdaughter **Quellana**, helping to keep the Morninglord from falling into vengeance and despair. It was Koramia’s voice—soft but steadfast—that guided him back to the light. And after the war, it was she who urged him to seek out **The Weeping Mother**, to begin the long, painful mending of what once was love eternal.

Though Koramia does not hate her stepchildren, her life among them is one of quiet distance. To them, she is a living reminder of their mother’s sorrow. Few speak to her without bitterness. Yet she bears it with grace, for she knows their anger is born from love—a love she too once felt, and still honors.

Now, Koramia spends her days beside Lathander, tending to the beauty of the mortal world. Where lovers find each other against all odds, where an artist sees beauty in imperfection—there, the **Beloved Radiance** lingers.

  
**Gods of Neutrality**


**Ilmater**
God of Endurance, Pain, Perseverance, and Martyrdom. Among the children of the divine, none is more gentle nor more burdened than **Ilmater**, the **One Who Endures**. He is the god of **endurance, pain, perseverance, and suffering**, the patron of the oppressed and broken. His name is whispered by those who can no longer lift their heads, and by those who would bear another’s pain to ease their burden.

Ilmater was born of **Lathander’s** light and **Camorin’s** compassion, but he took after his uncle **Duimorka**, whose understanding of endings and rebirth gave him a quiet strength unlike any of his divine kin. From an early age, Ilmater and his sister **Rijen** were close to Duimorka, learning from him the truth that even gods must endure. Yet where Rijen sought to twist pain into deceit, Ilmater sought to transform it into love.

He is called **The One Who Endures**, for he does not command mortals to bear their burdens alone. Instead, he **takes their pain upon himself**—their grief, their hunger, their loss, their wounds. It is said that to see Ilmater in one’s darkest hour is to feel every hurt lifted away, every sorrow soothed, if only for a moment. His presence does not erase pain—it **shares** it. For to him, compassion is not pity, but the choice to _suffer with another_.

Ilmater’s voice is soft and steady, like the breath before tears. He teaches that pain, though cruel, can shape strength and virtue. That endurance is not silence, but faith—that even when all light fades, there is purpose in drawing one more breath. He teaches his faithful to **alleviate the suffering of others**, even if it means bearing it themselves. For what greater love exists than to carry another’s pain? 

When the **Divine War** consumed the heavens, Ilmater was among the first to see the truth behind his father’s fury. He looked upon Lathander—bringer of light, source of all creation—and saw the shadow in him: pride, anger, and grief. Ilmater dared to speak what no god would. He called out his father’s hypocrisy, reminding him that even the Morninglord was not without fault, that to judge Duimorka while harboring his own sin was to deny the dawn within himself.

For this, Ilmater was cast from his father’s favor, yet rather than flee, he turned to his uncle Duimorka’s side—not out of defiance, but out of love. He believed that reconciliation, not wrath, was the only path forward.

At the war’s height, **Lathander, Duimorka, and Ilmater** met upon the fields of broken stars. Words turned to blows, light to shadow. In his wrath, Lathander took up a **dagger forged from the scale of Agnoxaline, the World Eater**, a blade born of pure negative energy, capable of unmaking divine essence. With it, he struck down his son.

As the wound tore through his being, Ilmater fell to his knees, radiant blood searing the heavens. Yet even then, he did not curse his father. Through pain beyond comprehension, he looked into Lathander’s eyes and whispered,

> “If killing me will end your suffering, then strike again. Let my death be your peace.”

Those words shattered Lathander’s fury. His light dimmed, and his heart broke. With the aid of **Quellana** and **Koramia**, he laid down his weapon and fell to his knees beside his son, his tears mingling with divine blood.

Ilmater was saved—but forever changed. The dagger’s wound could not be healed, for it had pierced deeper than flesh. It became part of him, a mark of both his endurance and his love. The pain would never fade, and in that eternal agony he found purpose.

Now, Ilmater walks the worlds unseen, **bearing the pain of all who suffer**. His followers say that every groan of agony, every broken cry, every unspoken plea is a thread he carries within him. The more pain he endures, the greater his divinity grows. He does not seek worship, only remembrance—that mortals might see in his sacrifice the strength to keep going.

His temples are quiet places, filled not with gold or splendor but with the wounded and the weary. Priests of Ilmater do not ask for offerings; they offer themselves. They tend to the sick, comfort the dying, and walk barefoot into war zones to carry the wounded from the field. For to serve Ilmater is to suffer willingly, that others may live.

It is said that **every scar on Ilmater’s body tells a story**—not of his own battles, but of those he healed. And when the final soul in creation has been freed from pain, only then will the One Who Endures finally rest.



**Bellala** (The Mother of Sorcery)
Goddess of All Magic and Magical Creatures. Born of **Lathander**, the radiant god of creation, and **Koramia**, the goddess of love and beauty, **Bellala** was destined to be extraordinary. Her birth marked not only the union of divine light and mortal passion, but also the birth of **magic itself** within the realm of Camerinthious. From her first breath, the air shimmered with energy. Bellala’s divine essence was unlike that of any other. She was fascinated from childhood by her half-sister **Quellana**, the Wild Empress, whose power shaped the living world—the beasts, the forests, the storms. Bellala watched her sister’s creations with awe and envy, for while Quellana’s beasts were bound by nature, Bellala yearned to create things that transcended it.

And so she began to **weave the Arcane**—the raw, untamed magic that flows through all realms. From her imagination sprang **fantastical creatures** unlike any seen before: phoenixes wreathed in fire that never dies, unicorns that tread between worlds, and spirits of pure mana that dance within the storms. 
Through Bellala, **magic itself entered the mortal realm.** Her voice was the spark that ignited the first spell; her breath was the wind that whispered secrets to those with minds sharp enough to hear them. Mortals who studied her patterns became the first **wizards**, shaping her essence with will and knowledge.

But Bellala’s magic was not limited to study or ritual—it was life itself. Through her divine experimentation, she **infused mortal souls with arcane essence**, creating the first **sorcerers**, mortals born with magic flowing through their veins. She became known as the **Mother of Sorcery**, for she alone could weave mortal souls from pure magic. It is said that her power rivals even her father’s, for while Lathander gives life, **Bellala gives that life purpose, power, and wonder.**

Her touch was also the source of **lycanthropy** and other magical afflictions, gifts and curses born from her reckless love of chaos. She delighted in the unpredictable, in creation without boundaries. Like her father Bellala could almost always be found by her mother in the bed of mortal woman giving birth to some of the most powerful arcane wielders to walk the face of Camerinthious. Though wild and often mischievous, her actions were never cruel—she simply wished to see what might be possible. 

When the **Divine War** erupted, Bellala’s passion flared as brightly as her father’s light. Refusing to remain a passive observer, she used her boundless magic to form an arcane militia of mortal spellcasters and enchanted beasts, the first army of its kind.

At its head stood Bellala herself and her mortal-born son—her chosen avatar known among mortals known as **Redderferth**, or **Red**—a being of immense magical power who embodied her fiery spirit. Together they fought under **Lathander’s banner**, wielding storms of magic that split mountains and reshaped the very skies. It was said that when Bellala cast her will, even the gods looked away, for her magic was the reflection of creation itself—pure, unbridled, and infinite.

After the war’s end, when silence returned to the heavens and the divine turned inward, Bellala found herself alienated. To many gods, her birth—half divine, half mortal—was an abomination, a living reminder of Lathander’s greatest sin. Her ability to create souls from magic unnerved them; even Duimorka, the Keeper, is said to have watched her with wary respect.

But Bellala was never one to seek approval. She returned to her mother **Koramia**, sharing her time between the mortal and divine realms, exploring every secret the arcane had to offer. Where others saw danger, she saw beauty. Where others feared chaos, she saw possibility.

Mortals who hear her call often speak of dreams filled with color and sound—visions of impossible creatures. Those who answer her are forever changed: some blessed with brilliance, others consumed by madness. For Bellala’s gift is both **wonder and warning**—the arcane is not meant to be controlled, only understood through experience, risk, and passion.


Now, Bellala is worshipped by **mages, scholars, sorcerers, and dreamers**—those who reach for knowledge beyond mortal grasp. Her temples are built not of stone but of **light and illusion**, constantly shifting in form. Her followers claim that magic is not a tool but a conversation, and Bellala is its voice.

She is wild and radiant, untamed and loving, unpredictable and divine—the living heart of magic, the spark that refuses to fade.

Wherever a spell is cast, wherever a creature of wonder draws breath, wherever mortal hands shape the unseen into art—  
**there, the Mother of Sorcery smiles.**




**Persana and Umberlee**
God of Justice and Calm Waters & Goddess of Wrath and the Tempest. 
Among the many divine children of **Lathander** and **Camorin**, none are more closely bound—or more tragically divided—than the divine twins: **Persana** and **Umberlee**, born in the same breath of dawn and tide. They are the twin spirits of the sea, the ever-shifting balance between serenity and fury, justice and chaos, life and destruction.

**Persana**, god of **Justice, Balance, and the Calm of the Sea**, is said to have been born in silence—when the morning light first touched still waters. His presence is deep and commanding, like the ocean’s endless expanse. Though gentle in demeanor, there is strength in his calm; for when injustice stirs the depths, his fury crashes forth with the power of a storm.

Persana loves deeply, both his divine kin and the mortals who sail his waters. He is steadfast, patient, and noble, a guardian of both sea and soul. In the days of peace, he often inspired his siblings—teaching **Quellana**, the Wild Empress, to craft the beasts of the deep, and learning serenity and empathy from **Ilmater**, his younger brother, whose endurance gave the ocean its quiet grace. To Persana, the sea is not merely a domain—it is a reflection of the divine heart. Calm when justice reigns, wild when righteousness demands it. Sailors who seek safe passage whisper his name before setting sail, casting offerings of polished shells or pearls into the waves as tribute to the Ocean Judge.

His twin, **Umberlee**, is his mirror and his tempest. The **Goddess of Wrath, Storms, and Raw Emotion**, she was born amidst thunder and crashing waves. Her laughter is the sound of breaking surf, her anger the roar of the hurricane. To mortals, she is both worshiped and feared—the **Queen of the Depths**, unpredictable and untamed.

While Persana represents the sea’s quiet wisdom, Umberlee embodies its cruel beauty and untouchable rage. She delights in her power, proud and vain, demanding reverence from sailors and coastal dwellers who pray not for favor, but for mercy. Offerings of gold, songs, and sacrifices are cast into the waves to stay her wrath, for Umberlee is known to drag the unfaithful into her cold embrace without hesitation.

Yet beneath her fury lies a soul of fierce love and longing. She loves her brother, Persana, as deeply as she hates his restraint. To her, his calm feels like rejection—his patience a denial of the passion that fuels her storms. Together they complete the sea’s nature: **his justice brings order, her emotion gives it soul.**

When the **Divine War** consumed the heavens, the sea itself was torn apart by their division. Persana stood with their father, **Lathander**, bound by loyalty and duty to the light. Umberlee, in her fury and pride, cast her lot with their uncle **Duimorka**, drawn to the god who understood sorrow and endings better than any other.

Their love turned to rivalry. Each time they met upon the battlefield, the ocean shuddered—tides clashed, whirlpools formed, and storms split the skies. Yet neither sought to kill the other. Their battles became contests of will and strength, each striving to prove themselves the truer child of the sea.

Mortals tell of one clash so mighty that it split the ocean floor, birthing the first trenches and the dark, unknowable places where no light dares go.

When the **Divine War** ended and peace returned, Persana’s steadfast loyalty did not go unrewarded. **Lathander**, in gratitude, granted his son dominion over the ocean’s calm depths and created for him his own people—the **Tritons**, **Sea Elves**, and the **Fishfolk**—to worship and serve him. These children of the sea sing hymns to their god in the darkest waters, their voices rising like bubbles toward the sunlit surface.

But this divine favor stoked **Umberlee’s envy and wrath**. She saw her brother’s gifts as an insult, a reminder of what she had lost. She vowed that if she could not destroy his mortals outright, she would turn them against him. To this day, Umberlee whispers into the currents, luring sailors and sea-dwellers to her worship through promises of freedom, power, and passion.

And so, the sea remains divided: the calm blue waters of **Persana’s grace**, and the storm-tossed tempests of **Umberlee’s fury**. Ships caught between them are said to be at the mercy of whichever twin’s heart rules the tide that day.

Even now, Persana still loves his sister. When storms rise, he does not strike her down but meets her rage with patience. For he knows that even in her wrath, **Umberlee’s heart beats with the same divine rhythm as his own**—the endless pulse of the sea itself.


**Cyborus**
God of Law, Order, and the Divine Scales. Born of **Lathander**’s radiant light and **Camorin**’s patient compassion, **Cyborus** stands as the middle child of the Prime Lineage—a bridge between dawn and dusk, passion and restraint. Where his elder siblings carried the fire of creation and the tides of emotion, Cyborus was born into stillness. From his first breath, the cosmos itself seemed to hush, for here was one who saw not merely what _was_, but what _must be._

Cyborus was gifted with the **Third Eye of Absolute Law**, a divine sight that pierces beyond time, beyond the whims of gods, to the **eternal structure of reality**—that which even divinity must obey. Through this eye, he perceives the **Threads of Balance**, the invisible laws that bind creation together. To mortals, he is the **God of Law, Order, and Balance**; to the gods themselves, he is the silent judge who ensures that no power—no matter how bright or terrible—ever outweighs the other.
His gift, however, is also his burden. For Cyborus sees all futures—the rise and fall of empires, the birth and death of gods, the endless turning of the cosmic cycle. He carries the knowledge that all things must end, and that even light and love can become destructive when unbalanced. To hold such knowledge is to know sorrow deeper than eternity, yet Cyborus endures it with calm, for **law must remain impartial, even to grief.**

When the **Divine War** erupted among his kin, Cyborus stood apart from both sides. While his father **Lathander** and his uncle **Duimorka** clashed, he watched in silence, ensuring that neither’s power would overwhelm the other. His presence was felt in the stillness between strikes, in the moments where time itself seemed to hold its breath.

But in his visions, Cyborus saw something terrible—a **future where the war never ends**, where the gods, unchecked, consume all creation in their pride. For countless years of battle, he resisted interference, holding to his nature as the neutral arbiter of divine law. Yet when he saw the scales tipping toward annihilation, he made a choice that defied his very essence:

He took up his father’s side.

At the war’s apex, Cyborus descended from his throne of stillness, wielding the dagger of **Agnoxaline the World Eater**, a weapon and relic that would be given to tip the scales in the direction of his father. With a single selfish act, he restored balance to the battlefield, stilling gods and storms alike. But by choosing a side, he **wounded his own soul**, for a being of perfect neutrality cannot act in bias without fracturing their own essence.

To contain the chaos and prevent such destruction from ever again reaching the mortal realm, Cyborus used his final act of divine will to forge the **Divine Gate**—a vast barrier of law and energy that separates the mortal world from the realms of the gods. To protect the mortal realm from the inevitable war of the gods, a war to end all wars.

After the war, Cyborus withdrew from his divine family. Though he still loves them, he understands that his role lies beyond affection. From the **Sanctum of Equilibrium**, a celestial citadel suspended between planes, he observes all creation. Through the gaze of his Third Eye, he measures every act, every sin, every virtue, ensuring that **law, order, and balance preside over all things**.

He speaks rarely, and when he does, even the gods listen. His voice is described as the stillness before judgment, calm yet unyielding. It is said that when he blinks, entire centuries pass; when he opens his eye, reality trembles beneath the weight of divine truth.

Mortals who serve him—known as **Absolute Law**—act as judges, lawmakers, and peacekeepers. They believe justice is not mercy, nor cruelty, but the sacred act of restoring harmony. To them, emotion is fleeting, but **balance is eternal.**

Cyborus is not worshiped for love, but for stability. His temples are built at the meeting of opposites—where rivers meet the sea, where day and night share the horizon, where chaos and order touch but do not blend.

He does not ask for devotion, only **discipline**.

For when all else fades—when gods fall, when stars die, when the seas dry and the dawn burns out—  
**only balance will remain.*

  

**Gods of Misfortune**

**The Horned One** (Asmodeus)
Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, God of Sin, Ambition, and Eternal Punishment. Among all the children of the divine, none bear a tale so steeped in pain, betrayal, and fury as **Asmodeus**, the son of **Duimorka**, God of Death, and **Rijen**, the Goddess of Lies and Deception. His birth was not a celebration of divine creation but an omen — the consummation of what the gods themselves deemed _unholy._
When Asmodeus came into being, the heavens shuddered. His mother’s deceit and his father’s sorrow gave form to something neither god nor mortal could understand. He was born with the **mark of the condemned** — his skin black and red as molten stone, his body crowned with great **ram-like obsidian horns**, and jagged crystals of shadowed flame bursting from his flesh. His divine spark was tainted by both life and death, light and darkness, making him a living contradiction.
The gods looked upon him and recoiled. **Lathander**, shamed by his brother’s sin, and **Camorin**, still broken from betrayal, **cursed the child** so that his very presence would sear mortal souls and twist the divine light that touched him. Even as an infant god, Asmodeus was shunned — an abomination not for what he did, but simply for existing.
And so he grew in isolation, hated by all save his father, who pitied him.

During the **Divine War**, Asmodeus fought not out of loyalty, but survival. The gods of light saw in him only a weapon or a monster to be slain. It was **Chakar**, the God of Murder and Lathander’s son, who finally found him. In a desperate bid to earn his father’s favor, Chakar **struck Asmodeus down**, piercing his heart with a blade of unholy flame and leaving his broken form to burn upon the battlefield.
But **Duimorka**, the Keeper, could not bear to lose his child. He descended into the ruins and **breathed divinity back into his son**, restoring his life with the cold spark of undeath. Yet when Asmodeus awoke, he cursed his father’s name. “You should have let me rest,” he cried. “You do not give life — you trap souls in torment.” To him, resurrection was not mercy, but a **sentence of eternal suffering.**
Broken and furious, Asmodeus sought solace in his mother, **Rijen**, hoping that she might offer the love the gods had denied him. For a time, she welcomed him with, whispering honeyed words that dulled the pain. But deceit was her nature.
When she saw what her son had become — powerful, twisted, and feared — she turned her venom upon him. Rijen revealed her hatred in a single, cruel truth:

> _“You are the reason the Morninglord no longer shines upon me. You are the proof of my shame. How could I love a creature like you?”_

She struck at him with divine venom, seeking to end what she had brought into existence. Asmodeus barely escaped her wrath, his body scorched, his soul shattered beyond repair. From that moment, whatever light remained within him was extinguished.

When the **Divine War** finally ended, there was no place in creation for Asmodeus. Neither the heavens nor the mortal realm would suffer his presence. The gods cast him down — not to death, but into **the churning void beneath the world**, where divine wrath and mortal sin congealed into a realm of torment.

There, Asmodeus took dominion.

He tore his own heart from his chest, setting it ablaze so that he might never feel again. From the ashes of his pain, he **forged the Nine Hells**, realms of punishment and cruel order. Each layer reflected a part of his suffering — betrayal, rage, isolation, despair, and endless hate.

He left only a single fragment of his heart intact: the part that burned with **pure hatred** — hatred for the gods who cursed him, for the mortals who prayed to them, and for the creation that had rejected him from birth.

Thus, **The Horned One** was born in truth. No longer a child of the gods, he became, the ruler of all that falls from grace. His voice echoes in every oath broken, every soul consumed by vengeance, every dream corrupted by pride.

To this day, **Asmodeus** rules the Nine Hells from his obsidian throne, his molten heart pulsing at its core. He tempts mortals and gods alike with promises of power, beauty, and revenge — for he knows that corruption begins not with hatred, but with desire.

He is the shadow of divinity, the reminder that the gods themselves are capable of cruelty and pride. And though he was cast away, his influence seeps upward through the cracks in creation, whispering:

> _“You cursed me for what I am. But it was you who made me so.”_



**Rijen** (The Great Deceiver)
Goddess of Lies, Secrets, and Deception. Of all the divine children born to **Lathander** and **Camorin**, none have brought more sorrow—or more fascination—than **Rijen**, the Great Deceiver. While her siblings embodied life, love, and law, Rijen was born beneath a hidden star, her first cry echoing like a whisper in the dark. From the beginning, she seemed... _different._
Where others sought harmony, she sought _truths to twist_. Where her siblings built, she unmade. It was not malice that drove her, but the gnawing curiosity of what might happen if the world’s fragile balance were broken. To her, peace was nothing more than the calm before a necessary storm.
Rijen found joy in deception. Her silvered tongue could make even the purest soul doubt their heart. She whispered to her brothers and sisters, turning their love into jealousy, their trust into suspicion. And though she played these games for sport, her father **Lathander**, the Morninglord, often saw through her illusions.

To be _seen through_ was the one wound Rijen could never bear.

For every truth Lathander uncovered, her resentment grew. She longed to make him believe a lie so perfect that not even his divine light could pierce it—a lie that would _shatter his faith in everything he loved._

Her eyes fell upon her uncle, **Duimorka**, the God of Death. Rijen saw in him a quiet sadness, a loneliness that mirrored her own. And from that, she wove her greatest deception.

At first, she played the innocent: lingering glances, soft laughter, the brush of her hand when he passed. Duimorka, noble and reserved, resisted at first. But her words, like dripping honey, wore away his resolve. She convinced him that what they shared was something sacred, something that could heal the pain both carried.

And so, one night, when Duimorka came to her chambers to confess his forbidden love, **Rijen greeted him unclothed, bathed in moonlight**. That night, passion and deceit entwined, and from that act was conceived **Asmodeus**, the child of sin and sorrow.

In the morning, the web tightened. Rijen told Duimorka she loved him—then went to Lathander and **spun her greatest lie**: that his brother had forced himself upon her, that she carried his child in shame.

This single deception **ignited the Divine War**, tearing heaven itself apart.

During the chaos of the Divine War, Rijen thrived. Lies became her weapons, secrets her soldiers. She turned gods against one another with a whisper, her manipulations spreading like wildfire through the pantheon. For a time, she believed herself untouchable—until her sister, **Quellana, the Wild Empress**, found her.

Their battle was fierce: nature’s fury against illusion’s guile. Quellana struck with vines of living flame and storms of truth, each blow forcing Rijen’s lies into the open. In the end, Quellana defeated her, **beating the truth out of her** until Rijen screamed not in pain, but in horror—because for the first time, she saw herself as she truly was: _empty._

After her defeat, Rijen wandered alone through the broken heavens. It was then that her son, **Asmodeus**, came to her. Both were scarred, abandoned, and despised. For a moment—just a heartbeat of divine time—Rijen looked upon her child and felt something unfamiliar: the stirring of love.

But love is truth, and Rijen could not bear the truth of what she had done. Instead, she twisted it. She told herself that everything—the war, the curse, her father’s hatred—was Asmodeus’s fault. That _he_ had ruined her life, not her lies.
She lured him close, whispering apologies and affection, and when his guard fell, **she struck**, seeking to kill him. Her blade failed, and Asmodeus escaped, leaving her alone once more—her final lie turned back upon her.

After the Divine War, Rijen was left with nothing. No throne, no followers, no family. Her siblings cursed her name; her parents would not speak of her. Even Duimorka, whose heart she had broken, turned his face from her.
Now she wanders the **Space Between**, a place of secrets and echoes. Her voice is the whisper that leads mortals astray, the temptation to hide truth for comfort, to tell lies in the name of love.

Her worshippers are spies, manipulators, and those who deal in forbidden knowledge. They do not build temples; instead, they whisper prayers into mirrors or carve her sigil—a broken mask—on hidden doors. They believe that every truth contains a lie, and every lie a sliver of truth. Rijen no longer lies for pleasure. She lies because she cannot stop. Deception is all she has left. Her words are hollow, her laughter brittle. She exists in the spaces between truth and falsehood, between love and hate, forever **the echo of a lie that once destroyed the heavens.**


**Tyrgul** (The Whispered Dark)
God of Fear, Panic, and the Shadows of the Heart. Born of **Lathander**, the Bringer of Light, and **Camorin**, the Weeping Mother, the god **Tyrgul** was the irony of divinity. For while his father embodied the dawn and his mother the warmth of nurture, Tyrgul’s presence carried only the **cold breath of dread**. From the moment he opened his eyes, mortals and gods alike shuddered in his presence. Wherever he walked, the air grew tense, and silence fell—as if even the world feared to offend him.

Tyrgul’s domain was not born of malice but of _emotion_. He is the god of fear, panic, and unease—the primal instincts buried within all living things. His power is the quiver in a soldier’s hand before battle, the mother’s cry for a lost child, the unease of darkness when one feels unseen eyes upon them. He does not create fear out of cruelty but merely reminds creation that **fear is proof of life**—the heartbeat before the dawn.

Of all the divine children, Tyrgul was perhaps the most misunderstood. His siblings shunned him for the unease he caused, and even his radiant father seemed to avoid his gaze. Lathander, who loved the laughter of mortals, could not bear the stillness that followed Tyrgul’s approach. Camorin, burdened by sorrow, pitied him but could not comfort him.

Tyrgul came to believe that his parents gave more love to the mortals they created than to their own divine offspring. While they showered the mortal world in warmth and guidance, he and his siblings were left in their light’s shadow.

The only one who ever truly _saw_ him was his sister, **Rijen**, the Goddess of Lies and Secrets. To her, fear was a useful ally—a veil behind which truth could hide. To him, she was the only soul who did not flinch at his touch. They shared whispered conversations in forgotten halls, their laughter soft and sharp as blades.

But the love Tyrgul felt for Rijen grew deeper than brotherly affection. In her cunning and cruelty, he saw beauty. In her lies, he saw the only truth that mattered: that even the gods could feel alone.

When Rijen began weaving the **Great Lie**—her scheme to shatter the family and ignite the Divine War—Tyrgul knew of it long before any other. He might have stopped her. Instead, he chose silence.
He told himself he was protecting her. In truth, he was afraid—afraid of losing the only one who made him feel less monstrous. So, while Rijen spun her lies, Tyrgul secretly used his divine gift to **sow fear and doubt** among the other gods, deepening the cracks she created. Every tremor of panic, every whisper of dread, every sleepless night among the divine was his doing.

When the **Divine War** erupted, Tyrgul stood at his father’s side—but not out of loyalty. He fought only to guide **Lathander’s wrath away from Rijen**, deflecting the Morninglord’s fury toward others. It was his fear that clouded the battlefield, his panic that drove armies to frenzy, his trembling touch that made gods doubt even their own cause.

In every moment of terror, Tyrgul was present—and in every scream, he heard his own.

When the war ended, Rijen’s lies were laid bare. She was cast down, her deceit exposed. Tyrgul sought her out once more, hoping for even a flicker of the connection they once shared. But she turned from him—whether in guilt, disgust, or indifference, he never knew. Whatever chance there had been between them was gone forever.

Consumed by grief and rejection, Tyrgul withdrew from his divine kin. He no longer sought their love or their light. Instead, he **became the shadow beneath their radiance**, feeding on the fear that mortals offered him through trembling prayers and terrified dreams.

To this day, Tyrgul wanders unseen through mortal minds. His voice is the whisper that wakes sleepers in the night, the chill down the spine, the pounding of a fearful heart. But his terror is never without purpose—he believes fear teaches strength, that panic reminds mortals of their limits and their will to survive.

Yet, even now, in his lonely divinity, **he still fears one thing above all: being forgotten**. And so, he spreads fear not just to sustain his power—but to remind the world, and his sister, that he _still exists._


**Chakar** (The Everlasting Hunger)
God of Murder, Bloodlust, and Silent Death. Born from the union of **Lathander**, the god of life and creation, and **Camorin**, the goddess of fate and change, **Chakar** was a paradox given divine form. From the first moment he opened his eyes, his parents felt something wrong. Where other divine children wept or laughed at birth, Chakar only smiled and reached for a knife that wasn’t there.

He was life’s cruel reflection — proof that even creation’s light could cast a shadow.

No joy, no purpose, no meaning could fill the vast emptiness that echoed within him. Where others loved, he felt nothing; where others created, he only destroyed. In every drop of blood spilled, he felt a fleeting warmth — a whisper of purpose — before the void returned. And so, he came to understand: _murder was his divine purpose_, and his victims his only form of prayer. Chakar is not the god of vengeance, nor justice, nor war. Those belong to other, lesser deities who believe death must serve a reason.  
Chakar kills **without reason**.
He is the god of the knife in the dark, the trembling hands that cannot stop themselves, the blood spilled for the thrill of seeing it steam on cold stone. His presence is the whisper that pushes mortals to their breaking point — the thought that says, _“You could end it now.”_

Unable to ever satisfy his divine hunger, Chakar planted shards of his essence into mortal hearts — a spark known as the **Crimson Urge**. Those who hear it feel the slow, crawling temptation to kill. They become assassins, slayers, or madmen who claim to hear a voice urging them on. It is said that every act of murder, from the most righteous vengeance to the most senseless slaughter, feeds Chakar’s eternal hunger.

Even so, each drop of blood only deepens his thirst. The god’s divine torment is that he cannot stop — he is _addicted to existence itself bleeding out before him._

When the **Divine War** erupted, Chakar cared little for cause or kinship. He joined **Duimorka’s side** not out of loyalty, but because that was where the most blood would flow. He killed gods, angels, and mortals alike, delighting in the chaos that followed.
But one act defined him: he hunted and **murdered Asmodeus**, his cousin — the cursed son of Duimorka and Rijen. He did it not for strategy, not even for hate, but for the simple thrill of killing a god.

When Duimorka resurrected Asmodeus, Chakar laughed for the first and only time, for in that act, his uncle had given him an eternal prey — one that could never truly die. From that day forward, **Chakar and Asmodeus have been bound**, hunter and hunted, mirror and reflection, each filled with pain the other cannot end.

When the dust of the Divine War settled, the other gods wept, rebuilt, or withdrew into their divine realms. Chakar did none of these things. He was unchanged — if anything, the war had only sharpened his edge.

He returned to the mortal realm, where he stalks the dreams of killers and soldiers alike. In every war, every crime of passion, every whispered threat turned to blood, his name is spoken in silence.

Mortals pray to him not for mercy — he has none — but for success in their violence. Assassins whisper his name before striking; generals burn sacrifices before battle; lovers driven to madness cry his name before plunging in the knife.

He answers them all with the same truth:

> _“There is no reason, no justice, no fate.  
> There is only the moment between heartbeats —  
> and I am that moment.”_
