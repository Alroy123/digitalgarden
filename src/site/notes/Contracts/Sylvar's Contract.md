## The Infernal Contract of the Bound Blade

**Let it be known across all circles of flame, shadow, and steel:**

On this day, by will freely given and blood freely shed, this pact is entered between:

**The Mortal Signatory**, hereafter referred to as _Sylvar Oriren_,  
and  
**Ichabod O’Railious**, Sovereign Spirit of the Bound Blade.

---

### Article I — Of the Binding

The Bearer willingly binds their soul to the vessel known as **Thunderscream**, within which the part Infernal Patron resides. This binding shall persist beyond sleep, death, and the veil between realms, unless dissolved under conditions outlined in Article VII.

The sword shall answer the Bearer alone, and the Bearer alone shall wield its full power.

---

### Article II — Of Power Granted

The Infernal Patron shall grant strength beyond mortal forging:

- Steel that bites deeper than mortal blades
    
- Fire that answers the Bearer’s will
    
- Whispers of battle, blood, and survival
    

These gifts shall grow in potency in proportion to deeds performed in accordance with this pact.

---

### Article III — Of the Harvest

The Infernal Patron’s greatest desire is thus declared and agreed upon:

- That the Bearer shall **slay worthy foes** with the Bound Blade
    
- That the **souls of the fallen**, taken by this blade, shall be **claimed by the Infernal Patron**
    
- That no soul taken by the blade may be barred from this claim by prayer, rite, or mercy once struck the killing blow
    

Each soul so claimed shall nourish the Infernal Patron and deepen the bond between blade and Bearer.

---

### Article IV — Of Intent and Restraint

The Infernal Patron acknowledges the Bearer’s prior oath concerning the **bloodline of Driselhiem** and the **Heir to the Throne**.

- The Bearer is not compelled by this contract to violate said oath
    
- However, the Infernal Patron shall not be bound by mercy, hesitation, or mortal morality in how it **guides, tempts, or advises** the Bearer
    
- The definition of _foe_ shall include any being who stands in opposition to the Bearer’s continued existence, purpose, or destiny
    

---

### Article V — Of Refusal

Should the Bearer knowingly refuse the claiming of a soul, or spare a soul that could have been claimed **without just cause**, the Infernal Patron may:

- Withhold a portion of its power
    
- Whisper doubt, fear, or wrath into the Bearer’s thoughts
    
- Demand recompense in blood at a later time
    

Three such refusals shall be marked as **Breach Pending**.

---

### Article VI — Of Death

Should the Bearer fall in battle while wielding the Bound Blade:

- Their soul shall not pass to any god, ancestor, or afterlife of mortal design
    
- Instead, it shall be drawn into the blade, there to serve the Infernal Patron as fuel, guardian, or successor
    

This clause is irrevocable.

---

### Article VII — Of Severance

This pact may be broken only if **one** of the following is achieved:

1. The Infernal Patron is destroyed utterly across all planes
    
2. The Bound Blade is unmade by divine authority equal or greater than Idris itself
    
3. The Bearer willingly sacrifices their soul in an act that denies the Infernal Patron a harvest of souls forevermore
    

Failure in any such attempt shall strengthen the bond.

---

### Article VIII — Of Witness and Seal

This pact is sealed in fire, blood, and will.

Let the flames of the Lower Realms bear witness.  
Let steel remember this promise.  
Let the Bearer’s soul stand as collateral.

**Signed:**

✧ _[Ichabod O’Railious, etched in Infernal script]_  
✧ _[Sylvar Oriren, signed in blood]_
