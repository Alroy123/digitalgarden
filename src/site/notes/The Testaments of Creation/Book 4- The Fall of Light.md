### _Of Forbidden Love, Betrayal, and the First Blood of Heaven_

> _“No paradise endures untouched by desire.  
> Even light, when it burns too bright, casts its own ruinous shadow.”_

---

### **The Stillness Before the Storm**

The world of Camerinthious thrived beneath the radiant gaze of the Prime Three and their children.  
The forests of Quellana swayed with song, the seas of Persana shimmered with life, and the mortals of the Dawn flourished in peace.

For a thousand ages, the heavens were still — until stillness turned to stagnation, and perfection became unbearable.  
The gods, though immortal, felt something stirring within them — a longing unnamed, a hunger that only the mortal heart had known.

And from that hunger, the cracks began to form.

---

### **The Sorrow of the Keeper**

Of the Prime Three, **Duimorka** was ever the most silent.  
He had known no joy but in duty — to guard the boundary between life and death, to keep the souls of mortals in eternity.  
He watched his brother and his wedded bathe in the worship of mortals, and though envy never took him, loneliness did.

Though both **Lathander** and **Camorin** loved him as a brother, **Duimorka** had never known the warmth of true companionship — the kind that bound hearts rather than fates. Surrounded by gods yet set apart by his solemn duty.

He saw in the mortals what he lacked — the laughter shared between lovers, the simple joy of touch, the ache of longing and loss. In every fleeting life he ushered into the beyond, he sensed something divine hidden in their mortality — a passion he, in all his eternity, had been denied.

It was this yearning, this quiet hunger for connection, that would one day lead him down the path of temptation and tragedy. For even gods, it seemed, were not immune to loneliness

And Rijen — the _Great Deceiver_, daughter of Lathander and Camorin — saw that loneliness as clearly as the stars see the night.  

>Thus began the _Deception of Rijen_ — the greatest and most terrible lie of the gods.  
>She wove her snare with patience.  
>At first, glances across temple halls.  
>The, laughter shared in secret.  
>The, longing that neither dared name.

### **The Lie to End All Lies**


She whispered to him in the long hours between dusk and dawn, her words soft as silk and sharp as truth.

> _“You, the keeper of eternity, have never known its warmth.  
> You who give all life meaning — yet have none to hold your own.”_

At first, he resisted her words, thinking them mere play —  
but Rijen’s beauty was not of form, but of spirit.  
She reflected what others longed to see.  
And Duimorka saw in her not deceit, but understanding.

Until that night that defined the realm as it is now. **Duimorka** came to Rijen's chambers, the night hummed with tension, thick and heavy like molten gold. His chest ached with a war of desire and restraint, every step toward her door a battle between the sacred and the forbidden.

Before he could summon the courage to knock, the door swung open. There she was — **Rijen** unclothed in all her radiant splendor and unashamed, her body bathed in the pale silver of moonlight that clung to her curves. Her skin glistened, soft and inviting, every inch of her a temptation that seemed to call his very name.

Her hair spilled over her shoulders like a dark river, her eyes smoldering with mischief and unspoken promises. She stepped closer, letting the door close silently behind her, trapping them in a bubble of heat and shadow.

“Why do you linger, Keeper of the End?” she murmured, her voice velvet and flame. “Do you crave me… or fear the consequences of what you know you want?”

Duimorka’s hand brushed against hers, and a jolt of heat surged through him. He wanted to look away, to remember his duty, but the moonlight dancing on her skin held him captive. Her lips parted slightly, and the scent of her — honey, wildflowers, something untamed — filled his senses.

Rijen stepped closer still, pressing the warmth of her body against his, the subtle sway of her hips a siren’s call. Her fingers traced the line of his jaw, the strength in his chest, igniting a hunger in him that was deeper than reason, hotter than any mortal flame.

> _“Then come,” she whispered, breath tickling his ear. “If you dare.”_

And in that instant, the world outside — the gods, the laws, the very threads of fate — ceased to matter. All that existed was the two of them, a collision of power and passion, a moment that would birth fire, sin, and the first crack in the divine order. He spoke the truth that had consumed him:

> _“I love thee, though I should not.”_

Rijen smiled, and for a fleeting moment, perhaps she truly did feel love.  
Or perhaps that, too, was a lie. 

When finally they parted, even briefly, the air itself seemed to shimmer with the aftermath of their union, charged and trembling. Duimorka’s gaze held hers, and in that single look, unspoken promises, devotion, and the weight of destiny were exchanged. The night had witnessed the spark of a tragedy yet to unfold, a desire that would shape the course of gods and mortals alike, and the first steps of a story that could not — would not — be undone.

From that union came a child — the cursed one, the **Horned Son**, _Asmodeus_.  
A god born not of light, nor of shadow, but of deception itself.

---

### **The Breaking of Heaven**

Rijen knew that if Lathander learned the truth, he would see through her deceit.  
So she crafted a story that would tear heaven in half.

She came before her father, eyes filled with divine tears, and cried:

> _“Duimorka has defiled me! He has taken what was pure!”_

And the Morninglord’s fury burned brighter than the sun.  
He cast his brother from the golden courts, calling him a defiler, a monster.  
Camorin wept for both her brother and her child, her tears flooding the mortal world once more.

Duimorka, shamed and heartbroken, did not defend himself.  
He believed her love true — even now.  
He bore his guilt in silence, knowing not that he had been deceived.

Thus the heavens split, and the **Divine War** began.

---

### **The War of the Dawn**

Sides were chosen:

**Lathander – The Morninglord, Father of Light**  
The war began in a shattering of trust, yet Lathander bore the burden of leadership. The Morninglord sought to protect the balance of his family and the mortal realms. He wielded his light like a sword, rallying the faithful and the creatures of the dawn to fight against the forces of deceit and darkness. Yet even he was not immune to despair; the lies of Rijen cut deep, shaking his divine heart, leaving him vulnerable to doubt and wrath.

**Koramia – The Goddess of Love and Beauty**  
Koramia, the mortal who became divine, stood as a pillar of warmth and hope. She healed the wounded, inspired courage among the faithful, and lent her divine power to protect those caught in the crossfire. Through her, mortals learned resilience, love, and devotion even in times of turmoil. She encouraged reconciliation and sought to temper the anger of gods, particularly Lathander, reminding him of the power of compassion even amidst betrayal.

**Quellana – The Wild Empress, Goddess of Nature**  
Quellana became a force of untamed fury and protective love during the war. She rallied the beasts of the land and sky, turning forests, jungles, and mountains into battlegrounds against Rijen’s lies and Duimorka’s ambition. With roots, vines, and enchanted beasts, she struck at those who would harm her father, guiding him away from vengeance and toward clarity. Her role was both shield and sword, the chaos of nature tempered by loyalty and insight.

**Ilmater – The One Who Endures**  
Ilmater was the first to question his father’s anger, recognizing that even the Morninglord was not flawless. He took upon himself the suffering of mortals and gods alike, walking through the battlefield bearing pain and relieving suffering where he could. His willingness to endure became both a rallying cry and a moral compass for others. Even when mortally wounded by Lathander himself, Ilmater refused to yield, offering his life as a mirror for the folly of untempered anger.

**Bellala – Goddess of Magic and Magical Creatures**  
Bellala brought arcane power to the mortal soldiers, crafting enchanted beasts and war constructs that fought alongside divine and mortal forces. She trained arcane militias, led by her avatars, and infused the battlefield with the unpredictable chaos of magic. Her role was essential: she amplified the power of mortals and made the tide of war ever-shifting, blending wild creativity with disciplined power.

**Persana – God of Justice and Calm Seas**  
Persana commanded the ocean and coastal realms, protecting naval fronts and controlling the tides against Duimorka’s forces. Calm yet inexorably strong, he inspired his allies to act with honor and discipline. His presence reminded combatants that justice could temper destruction, even as the waves crushed enemy fleets and elemental minions.

**Umberlee – The Queen of the Depths**  
Umberlee, Persana’s twin, chose her uncle’s side, unleashing storms, hurricanes, and tidal waves that shattered the coastal defenses of Lathander’s followers. Her wrath was fearsome and beautiful, demonstrating the danger of divine power when unchecked by compassion. While she never sought the total destruction of her family, her chaos left lasting scars on the mortal world and divine realms alike.

**Cyborus – God of Law and Balance**  
Cyborus initially remained neutral, observing the war to ensure no side gained absolute dominance. His third eye saw potential outcomes, and he intervened only at the apex, when the conflict threatened to tear creation asunder. By aiding Lathander strategically, he restored balance but at great personal cost, straining his soul and forcing him to create the Divine Gate to separate mortals from future divine wrath.

**Rijen – The Great Deceiver**  
Rijen’s lies ignited the war, manipulating Duimorka and others to sow discord. She worked in shadows, spreading doubt and betrayal, targeting even her own kin. Her cunning was unmatched, and her ability to twist truth into weaponized deception made her a terrifying adversary. Only when confronted by Quellana was the truth forced from her, yet even then, her ambitions lingered, particularly toward her cursed son.

**Tyrgul – God of Fear and Panic**  
Tyrgul’s allegiance was a twisted loyalty; he remained nominally on Lathander’s side but used his powers to misdirect divine energies, protect Rijen, and instill fear in the hearts of mortals and gods alike. His subtle manipulations created uncertainty and hesitation among Lathander’s allies, while he quietly nurtured his own ambitions and desires.

**Chakar – God of Murder**  
Chakar thrived in the carnage of the war. He allied with Duimorka purely for the thrill of violence, spreading murder and chaos wherever he went. His presence in battle amplified the bloodlust of mortals, turning skirmishes into nightmares of endless death. For him, the Divine War was sport, and he relished every act of brutality.

**Duimorka – God of Death**  
Duimorka, wove death and decay into the battlefield, raising fallen combatants as revenants and commanding the forces of undeath. He sought to exploit the chaos of lies and mortal suffering to consolidate power, challenge Lathander’s authority, and reshape the world in his vision.

**Asmodeus – The Horned One**  
Though only recently reborn, Asmodeus’ presence was a spark of chaos. He struggled with his hatred and trauma, making his actions unpredictable. His existence became a symbol of the consequences of passion, betrayal, and divine manipulation, a living embodiment of the war’s cost and the personal stakes for every god.

The heavens became a battlefield.  
The seas boiled, forests burned, and the stars dimmed from sorrow.

And in the midst of it all, the son of deceit — **Asmodeus** — walked among gods and mortals alike, loathing his own existence.  
For he knew he was both sin and consequence, born of two lies — his mother’s deceit, and his father’s silence.

---

### **The First Murder of Heaven**

In the height of battle, **Chakar**, ever eager for slaughter, sought to prove his worth to Lathander.  
He found Asmodeus, weak and wandering between both sides, and struck him down.  
The Horned One fell, his black blood seeping into the soil, burning the earth to ash.

When Duimorka found his son’s body, something within him broke.  
He defied death itself and **brought Asmodeus back**, pouring his divine essence into the corpse.

But Asmodeus rose not in gratitude — he rose in hatred.

> _“You should have let me die,”_ he screamed. _“For what life is there for the unwanted?”_

He turned from his father, broken and furious. Asmodeus sought solace in his mother, **Rijen**, hoping that she might offer the love the gods had denied him. For a time, she welcomed him with, whispering honeyed words that dulled the pain. But deceit was her nature.
When she saw what her son had become — powerful, twisted, and feared — she turned her venom upon him. Rijen revealed her hatred in a single, cruel truth:

> _“You are the reason the Morninglord no longer shines upon me. You are the proof of my shame. How could I love a creature like you?”_

She struck at him with divine venom, seeking to end what she had brought into existence. Asmodeus barely escaped her wrath, his body scorched, his soul shattered beyond repair. From that moment, whatever light remained within him was extinguished.
He descended into the **Nine Hells**, building a kingdom of torment beneath creation —  
a mirror of the heavens that had cast him out.

---

### **The End of the War**

The Divine War raged for an age.  
At its peak, Lathander, Duimorka, and Ilmater stood against one another.  
The Morninglord, blinded by grief and fury, struck his son down with a dagger of pure void — the very scale of Agnoxaline himself.

Ilmater did not fight back.  
Instead, he took his father’s hand, pressed the dagger against his own heart, and whispered:

> _“If my death will ease your pain, then let it be so.”_

Those words shattered Lathander’s rage.  
He cast down his weapon and wept, his tears of light falling across the battlefield.  
Quellana and Koramia — goddess of love and beauty — came to his side, begging him to see reason.

And so the war ended, not with triumph, but with sorrow.

---

### **The Broken Heavens**

In the silence that followed, the gods counted their scars.  
Ilmater lived, but his wound would never heal — a constant reminder of his father’s fury.  
Duimorka withdrew from the world, mourning his lost son and his own foolish heart.  
Rijen, unrepentant, wandered the empty halls of heaven, her lies now her only companions.  
Asmodeus, in the depths below, nursed his hatred into fire.  
Camorin, now the _Weeping Mother_, turned her gaze from the divine and devoted herself to the mortal souls abandoned in the war.

And Lathander — the Morninglord, once radiant beyond measure — swore to never again walk the mortal realm in flesh.  
His light dimmed, his laughter gone.  
He built a heaven of gold, but found no joy within it.
