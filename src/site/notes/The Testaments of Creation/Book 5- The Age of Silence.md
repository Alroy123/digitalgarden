### _Of the Long Twilight, and the Dawn That Never Came_

> _“When gods fall silent, the world must remember their songs —  
> for even silence is a kind of prayer.”_

---

### **The Ashes of Heaven**

After the _Divine War_, the heavens were as ash and dust.  
The firmament, once bright with the song of creation, now hung dim —  
its light dulled by sorrow, its stars the hollow eyes of fallen angels.

The earth itself bore scars.  
Where Lathander’s light struck the ground, deserts of glass now shimmered.  
Where Duimorka’s shadow fell, the soil turned black and lifeless.  
Where Camorin’s tears had poured, rivers ran with silver sorrow.

The age of miracles was over.  
Mortals who once prayed to gods that answered found only echoes.  
Temples grew quiet, altars cold.  
The _Age of Silence_ had begun.

---

### **The Fading of the Divine**

The gods withdrew into solitude:

- **Lathander**, weary of his own perfection, ascended beyond the sun,  
    his light now distant, softer — not the blinding dawn, but a tired warmth that rose each morning and set each night.  
    To mortals, he became _The Distant Morning_, a promise of renewal that never quite fulfilled itself.
    
- **Camorin**, the Weeping Mother, descended to the mortal realm,  
    her eyes hollow sockets that bled starlight.  
    She wandered among the dying, guiding their souls to Duimorka’s realm.  
    To mortals, she was both mercy and fear — the soft hand that led them from life to death.
    
- **Duimorka**, the Keeper, sealed himself beyond the veil.  
    His heart, once broken by betrayal, became cold iron.  
    He tended to the souls of the dead in silence,  
    waiting for the day when all creation would return to him.

### **The Scattered Children**

The divine children, too, fell to their destinies —  
some fading, some thriving, all changed forever.

- **Quellana**, the Wild Empress, withdrew into the deepest forests.  
    Her laughter became the rustle of leaves, her tears the morning dew.  
    She still spoke to beasts and birds, teaching them the language of life.  
    To those who listened, she whispered the lesson of balance:  
    _“Even the wild must heal.”_
    
- **Ilmater**, forever wounded by his father’s blade,  
    descended among mortals to dwell as one of them.  
    Wherever there was suffering, he walked unseen —  
    bearing others’ pain so they could endure their own.  
    His temples rose in the hearts of the kind and the broken.
    
- **Cyborus**, his third eye weary from seeing too much,  
    stood at the edge of creation, watching the Divine Gate he forged.  
    He knew another war would come one day —  
    not of gods, but of mortals who inherited their pride.  
    Until then, he watched, unblinking.
    
- **Persana**, the calm tide, ruled the oceans with quiet majesty.  
    From Lathander’s blessing, he birthed new children — the **Tritons** and **Sea Elves** —  
    mortals who would sing praises beneath the waves for eternity.  
    Yet his twin, **Umberlee**, burned with jealousy,  
    her storms battering ships and drowning sailors just to hear them beg.  
    So was born the endless rivalry of the seas — justice against wrath, peace against passion.
    
- **Rijen**, the Great Deceiver, was cast adrift between realms.  
    Her lies became shadows; her voice became the whisper of doubt.  
    In every heart where guilt festers or secrets thrive,  
    her laughter can still be heard faintly — mocking, mournful, unrepentant.
    
- **Tyrgul**, the Lord of Fear, lingered unseen,  
    his presence felt only in the stillness before storms or the silence before death.  
    He spread panic through dreams,  
    hoping Rijen would one day look upon his terror and call it love.  
    She never did.
    
- **Chakar**, unchanged by it all,  
    still walked unseen in the blood of mortals,  
    his whisper the promise of vengeance and the thrill of the kill.  
    His gift — or curse — endured in mankind:  
    the lust for retribution that would forever haunt their kind.
    
- **Asmodeus**, the Horned One, sat enthroned in the Nine Hells,  
    his shattered heart beating once for each sin of creation.  
    He watched the gods grow quiet and the mortals forget.  
    And he smiled —  
    for in silence, hate festers best.
    
- **Bellala**, the Mother of Sorcery,  
    whose mother Koramia yet lived among the divine,  
    filled the mortal world with wonder and danger alike.  
    She taught some to shape the arcane,  
    and from her blessing came the first **sorcerers** —  
    mortals born of magic itself.  
    To others she gave only temptation,  
    for magic was a flame that both enlightened and devoured.

### **The Fate of Mortals**

The mortals, left alone beneath the quiet heavens,  
learned to worship not the gods themselves,  
but the _echoes_ of them — the virtues and vices that lingered:

- To Lathander, they prayed at dawn, asking for renewal.
    
- To Camorin, they prayed at dusk, seeking safe passage.
    
- To Duimorka, they offered remembrance,  
    for even endings deserve gratitude.
    
- To Ilmater, they begged for endurance.
    
- To Umberlee, they pleaded for mercy at sea.
    
- To Bellala, they sought the secrets of magic.
    
- And to Asmodeus, though none would admit it,  
    they prayed in fear, their whispered sins feeding his growing dominion.
    

From these prayers, faith was born — and faith became power.  
Even in silence, the gods endured through the hearts of mortals.  
Their wars, loves, and betrayals echoed through time,  
reborn in every generation.

### **The Prophecy of the Final Dawn**

In the ruins of the old heavens, Cyborus the Watcher looked beyond the veil and saw what would one day come:

A world where mortals would grow strong —  
so strong they would no longer need their gods.

And in that world, he saw the shadow of the **Second Dawn** —  
a day when the Divine Gate would crack,  
when gods and mortals would once again meet,  
not as creators and children,  
but as rivals and equals.

Until that day, he kept watch —  
the last of the Prime blood to remain steadfast.
