### _Of Love, Creation, and the Fall of the Morninglord_

### **The Loneliness of the Morninglord**

The Age of Peace had endured a thousand generations.  

Yet in the heart of **Lathander**, the Morninglord, there stirred a quiet longing.  
He had built the dawn, shaped the soul, and filled the world with beauty —  
but creation without discovery had grown stale.

The mortals he made loved, laughed, and suffered with passion he could not feel.  
He looked upon them as a father — yet somewhere in his radiant heart, a forbidden envy bloomed.  
He wished to **understand** them — to feel as they felt, to love as they loved.

And so he descended.

### **The Mortal Who Stole the Heart of a God**

Among the mortals of the first dawn lived a woman named **Koramia**.  
Her beauty was said to still the winds; her laughter the sweetest song ever sung, capable of stirring the hearts of all who heard it. Her hair fell like liquid silver over shoulders that seemed sculpted by the sun itself, and her eyes shimmered with a light that mirrored the dawn—warm, inviting, and impossible to look away from. Her skin glowed softly, as if kissed by the first rays of morning, and her every movement carried the grace of wind flowing over untouched waters.

Yet it was not mere beauty that made her irresistible—it was the _fire within her heart_. A curiosity, a fearless spark that dared to question the heavens themselves, and a laughter that hinted at secrets known only to her. Men and women alike felt the pull of her presence, a magnetic force that awakened a longing they had never known, a desire that burned brighter than the first sunrise.

Lathander, wandering the mortal world in a form both radiant and approachable, found Koramia one fateful morning. From the moment his eyes fell upon her, he was enthralled—not simply by her form, though that was enough to stir a divine hunger—but by her very essence, the soul that glimmered with life and question. Every glance, every subtle smile, tugged at him with a desire that was equal parts worship and longing. Even as a god, he felt the ache of mortal passion, the pull to draw her close, to explore the mysteries of her mind and body as if the universe itself conspired to bring them together.

Koramia, aware of the gaze upon her, felt the stirrings of a dangerous fascination. She had never known a presence so warm, so alive, yet so impossibly vast—a being that seemed to hold the very dawn in his hands. And in that instant, the mortal and divine collided, two hearts caught in the magnetic dance of desire, curiosity, and destiny, a union that would shape the dawn of all creation.

Koramia saw Lathander not as a god to be worshiped but a kind soul, that just wants love. 
They stayed up all night talking of the world, of life and of love. 

> _“You have called my name in your heart, though you did not know it,”_ he said.  
> _“I am Lathander.”_

Koramia knelt, trembling, but the god lifted her chin.

> _“Do not bow to me, mortal. Tonight, I live not as a god, but as a man.”_

His hand hover near hers, tracing the faintest of patterns in the air, a whisper of a touch that made her shiver. Her eyes met his, and in that gaze was a question—and a silent permission—that sent a rush of longing coursing through him.

Lathander’s hands were gentle at first, tracing the curve of her neck, the slope of her shoulders, the warmth of her skin beneath the morning light. Every touch sparked a fire that leapt between them, a heat that was as much spiritual as it was physical. Koramia’s breath caught; every nerve in her body ached to be closer, to feel the fullness of his presence pressed against her.

When their lips finally met, it was as if the dawn itself had broken inside her. The kiss was slow, deliberate, and consuming. His mouth claimed hers with a hunger tempered by reverence, exploring her as though she were the very first beauty of creation. Koramia responded in kind, her hands threading through his golden hair, drawing him closer, feeling the strength of him press against the delicate curves of her body.

Clothing became a hindrance, cast aside almost without thought, until nothing remained between them but skin and heat. Lathander’s touch ignited her from the tips of her fingers to the crown of her head, and Koramia’s response—soft moans, whispered gasps, and the arching of her body—fed the fire between them. Every brush of skin, every press of lips and hands, seemed to echo through the morning, a rhythm as old and eternal as the rising sun itself.

Time lost meaning. The mortal and the divine became one in ways that were both tender and feral, exploring each other with a passion that left neither whole, yet both fully alive. Koramia, radiant in every way, moved with a grace and heat that captivated him utterly, while Lathander, god of dawn and creation, poured the fullness of his light and longing into her, making every touch a spark of divinity.

When the first light of true day flooded the horizon, they lay together, breathless and spent, the world outside still new and unformed. In that union, the threads of destiny were woven. The divine seed within her stirred—a spark that would become Bellala, the Goddess of Magic and Magical Beasts. Every heartbeat in that chamber echoed through eternity, a testament to desire, love, and the fateful merging of mortal and god.

Koramia, still trembling in his arms, felt the weight of both pleasure and prophecy. Lathander pressed a final kiss to her brow, a promise whispered with the authority of a god:

>_"From this love, the world shall know dawn itself."_

### **The Goddess of Love is Born**

The months that followed were a slow-burning tension between awe, desire, and fear. Koramia could still feel the lingering heat of Lathander’s touch on her skin, even when he was not there, and each night her dreams were filled with the memory of him—his golden hair, his gentle yet insistent strength, the way his hands and lips had ignited something in her that she could not name.

She sensed a change within herself before she even dared speak it aloud. A warmth, deep and constant, that was not of the mortal world. When at last she told Lathander, in the quiet of a meadow lit only by moonlight, he did not recoil. Instead, his eyes burned brighter than the dawn itself, a mixture of reverence, joy, and something almost too deep for her to comprehend.

_"Koramia,"_ he whispered, cupping her face with divine hands, _"from this love, life will spring. You carry a spark that will shake the heavens."_

The knowledge of her pregnancy awakened both wonder and fear. She had felt the yearning of men and women alike whenever she walked among mortals—the subtle pull of desire, the longing in their eyes—but now, intertwined with the divine, the craving for her became more than physical. It was as though every being, mortal and god, recognized the sacredness of what she bore.

Even as they walked together in secluded meadows or atop wind-swept hills, Lathander would draw her into his arms, his body radiating heat and light that made the skin on hers tingle and burn. Their lovemaking, though tempered by her condition, was a dance of reverence and passion. She was his muse, his equal in this mortal realm, and he treated her as both treasure and partner. Every caress reminded her that what they shared was forbidden yet fated—a love that would shape the very tapestry of the world.

Yet, even in the rapture, fear gnawed at her. What of Camorin, Lathander’s wedded heart? How could she navigate the divine consequences of this mortal love? Every shadow in the forest, every whisper of the wind seemed to carry judgment. And when Lathander, in mortal guise, would leave to attend to matters of the world or the dawn, Koramia felt both longing and an ache of loneliness that only his return could soothe.

In these months, she discovered the depth of her own strength. She was no longer merely a mortal woman; she was the vessel of a future goddess. She learned to walk with both grace and purpose, understanding that the life growing within her was tied to the arcane and the divine. At night, she would lie beneath the stars, her hand resting on her swelling belly, feeling the first stirrings of Bellala. And in those moments, Koramia knew that she was part of something far greater than herself—a spark of eternity born of both mortal curiosity and godly passion.

### **The Weeping Mother’s Sorrow**

Far above, in the golden halls of the Prime,  
**Camorin** — wife of Lathander, mother of his divine children — felt the tear before she saw it.

When she learned the truth, her grief shook the heavens.  
She tore her eyes from her face, for she could not bear to see the world her husband had defiled with betrayal.  
Her endless weeping flooded the lands, forming new seas.

The gods named her **The Weeping Mother**, and from that day, she no longer spoke her true name.  
Her tears gave birth to sorrow itself — a gift and a curse to mortals,  
for only those who grieve can truly understand love.

---

### **The Vow of Blood and of Promise**

Not all Camorin's children mourned quietly.  
From the anguish of **Camorin’s tears**, something darker stirred — a rage that festered in the heart of her son, **Chakar**, the God of Murder.

He felt his mother’s sorrow like a blade driven through his own soul. Every tear she shed became a whisper in his ear, calling for vengeance. His heart burned like iron in the forge of grief, and his hands trembled not with mercy, but with hunger — a divine yearning to make blood answer for tears.

He cloaked himself in shadow, and descended upon the mortal realm. His form was terrible to behold — a figure of divine wrath and silent purpose, his eyes like coals smoldering with hatred. The air around him curdled; even the night recoiled from his presence.

He found **Koramia** beneath the silvered boughs of her garden, the moonlight tracing the curve of her body, her belly heavy with divine life. She was radiant still, tending to flowers that bloomed only at her touch — each petal shimmering faintly with the light of dawn.

To Chakar, she was not beauty — she was betrayal.  
He stepped from the darkness, blade in hand, his voice a whisper that cut deeper than any steel.

> _“For mother’s pain, your blood shall be the offering.”_

Koramia turned, her eyes wide — not with fear, but pity.

> _“You are your mother’s son,”_ she said softly. _“You think vengeance will still her tears?”_

But before Chakar could strike, the world was swallowed in light.  
The shadows burned away, the garden trembled, and the heavens themselves parted.

**Lathander** had come.

The Morninglord’s radiance poured forth like a sunrise made flesh, each ray of light carrying both wrath and sorrow. His eyes blazed with divine fury as he seized his son by the throat. Chakar’s blade fell from his hand, turning to ash in the brilliance of his father’s light.

> _“You would murder love itself?”_ the Morninglord thundered. _“You would turn your mother’s grief into blood? Then live forever in the shadow of your crime.”_

The ground split open, and from it spilled an ocean of darkness. Lathander hurled his son into it, his voice ringing across creation.

> _“You are my son no longer — only the echo of murder, the hand that kills unseen. Let the night be your throne, and slaughter your only worship.”_

And thus was **Chakar** cast down, becoming the specter of slaughter and hatred. Wherever blood is spilled, his presence lingers — a shadow that feeds upon rage and grief.

When the fury faded, Lathander fell to his knees beside Koramia.  
She trembled in his arms, untouched but shaken, her tears falling like dew upon his radiant skin.

He looked upward, his gaze piercing the heavens — to where **Camorin**, his divine wife, wept endlessly, her sorrow flooding the sky with rain; to where **Duimorka** watched in silence, his face heavy with judgment; to the vast rift that now tore across creation, a wound carved by his own heart.

And in that moment, the Morninglord wept.

For the first time since the dawn, **Lathander**, god of light and creation, wept — his tears falling like molten gold upon the earth.

> _“What light can I offer a world I have burned?”_ he whispered. _“What dawn can come from this darkness I have sown?”_

Then, before all creation, he raised his hand and made his sacred oath:

> _“Let this be my punishment — my vow. Never again shall I walk the mortal world. Never again shall I take a form of flesh. I shall dwell only in the heavens, that my light may guide but never touch.”_

Thus was born the **Vow of the Morninglord** — the divine decree that sundered god from mortal forevermore.

But before his light faded from the world, Lathander turned to Koramia. Her tears gleamed upon her cheeks, and yet she still looked at him with love. He placed his hand upon her heart. The warmth of dawn poured through her veins; her mortal form shimmered and burned away, leaving something greater, purer, divine.

> _“You are divine now,”_ he whispered. _“May your love heal what mine has broken.”_

And in that moment, **Koramia**, the mortal who had captured the heart of a god, was transformed.  
She became **Koramia the Beloved**, **Goddess of Love and Beauty**, radiant beyond compare — her every breath a hymn of affection, her every glance a benediction.

From her womb, still aglow with divine fire, the child within stirred — **Bellala**, who would become the **Goddess of Magic**, the first born of mortal flesh and divine light.

And as the Morninglord ascended once more into the heavens, withdrawing his touch from the world, his final act of love remained below — a woman and her unborn daughter, the mortal flame that would one day ignite all magic and bind together the realms of gods and mortals alike.

### **The Mortals Flame **

Thus, love became a fire — one that gave light to all creation,  
but left the heavens scorched.

Camorin, in her grief, turned from her divine kin to guide mortal souls.  
Duimorka fell silent, watching love and loss entwine across eternity.  
Lathander withdrew, his light dimmed to a sorrowful glow.  
And from their pain, mortals learned passion — that joy and tragedy are the same flame,  
burning brightest just before it consumes.

> _“So ended the Third Book of the Dawn —  
> The Mortals Flame,  
> where love touched the divine,  
> and the divine learned to suffer.”_
