### _The Living Echoes of the Divine_

> _“Though their voices are silent, the world still sings their names.  
> For even in the age of men, the gods live — in the light, in the shadow, and in the breath between.”_

## **The Prime Three**


### **Lathander, The Morninglord**

**Titles:** The Dawnfather, The Distant Sun, The First Light  
**Domain:** Creation, Renewal, Life, and Hope  
**Symbol:** A radiant sun rising over a horizon of flame

Once the brightest of all divine, Lathander’s light has dimmed — but it still warms every dawn.  
To mortals, he is the promise that no night lasts forever.  
His priests preach rebirth and perseverance,  
and the weary still pray to him as they turn their faces to the rising sun.

Yet in every temple, there is one rule unspoken:  
**Never call upon the Morninglord at midnight.**  
For it is said that in the darkest hour, his light burns with regret,  
and his gaze brings sorrow rather than hope.

---

### **Camorin, The Weeping Mother**

**Titles:** The Lady of Tears, The Mother of Journeys, The Mourning Star  
**Domain:** Fate, Change and Acceptance 
**Symbol:** A tear falling upon a spiral path

Once the gentlest of the Prime Three, she now wanders unseen between the mortal and divine,  
her tears guiding souls from the living to the eternal.  
To the dying, she is comfort; to the living, a reminder that all paths end.

In some lands, midwives whisper her name during childbirth —  
for every birth, they say, is a promise she keeps to replace the soul she last took.

---

### **Duimorka, The Keeper**

**Titles:** The Deathless, The Keeper, The Shadow Beyond  
**Domain:** Death, Eternity, and Rest  
**Symbol:** A black circle within a white flame

He is the quiet god, the patient god —  
the one who waits for all things in their time.  
To him, death is not cruelty, but completion.  
His followers do not fear the grave; they tend to the dying and honor the fallen.

Yet even now, whispers say that in the deepest tombs,  
his shadow can be seen kneeling —  
as though he still mourns what even he could not keep.

---

## **The Children of the Dawn**


### **Quellana, The Wild Empress**

**Titles:** The Untamed Queen and Lady of Beasts  
**Domain:** Nature, Growth, Instinct, and Wild Magic  
**Symbol:** A crown of antlers entwined with ivy

To mortals she is the spirit of the living world,  
the huntress and the nurturer alike.  
Her laughter is thunder, her tears are rain.  
Those who live close to the land — druids, rangers, shamans —  
still call her name when they give thanks for a kill or a harvest.

They say she still walks the forests at twilight,  
a goddess crowned in green,  
her eyes full of forgiveness and fury alike.

---

### **Cyborus, The Absolute Law**

**Titles:** The Scales Eternal, The Watcher, The Arbiter of Truth  
**Domain:** Law, Balance, Fate, and Judgment  
**Symbol:** An open eye with a balanced as its iris

He is the god of order — calm, distant, unerring.  
Though few pray to him directly, his law touches all.  
The concept of justice itself, mortals say, came from his third eye,  
which once saw all possible futures and chose the fairest path.

His temples are quiet, his priests solemn.  
They speak not of faith, but of inevitability.

---

### **Ilmater, The One Who Endures**

**Titles:** The Broken Saint, The Eternal Martyr, The Merciful Hand  
**Domain:** Suffering, Compassion, Endurance, and Redemption  
**Symbol:** Two open hands bound in crimson cord

Ilmater walks still among mortals, unseen —  
in the places of pain, in the hearts of the kind.  
Those who suffer whisper his name for strength,  
and sometimes, they say, a gentle hand lifts their pain for a heartbeat.

He bears his father’s wound still,  
a divine scar that bleeds light when others weep.

---

### **Persana, Lord of the Calm Deep**

**Titles:** The Tidemaster, The Just Wave, Father of the Sea-Folk  
**Domain:** Water, Justice, Sea, and Protection  
**Symbol:** A trident above a calm ocean wave

To the sea-folk — the Tritons, Merrow, and Sea Elves — he is both creator and guardian.  
His song keeps the oceans from consuming the land.  
When storms threaten, sailors cast offerings to Persana —  
and if they survive, they praise his mercy at dawn.

---

### **Umberlee, The Queen of the Depths**

**Titles:** The Storm Maiden, The Drowned Goddess, The Sea’s Wrath  
**Domain:** Chaos, Emotion, Storms, and Destruction  
**Symbol:** A curling wave with a fang of lightning

Where Persana is mercy, she is fury.  
She is the crash of waves that drown ships, the howl of the hurricane.  
Yet mortals still worship her — not out of love, but fear.  
Even her brother honors her storms,  
for he knows that without destruction, creation grows stale.

---

### **Rijen, The Great Deceiver**

**Titles:** The Whispering Lie, The Veiled One, The Betrayer  
**Domain:** Lies, Secrets, Trickery, and Hidden Truth  
**Symbol:** A mask split in two — one side smiling, the other weeping

Her temples are forbidden, yet her name is never forgotten.  
Spies, politicians, lovers, and thieves still call upon her.  
She is the question beneath certainty,  
the whisper that drives truth to madness.

It is said that she walks the dreams of the deceitful,  
offering them comfort — or consequences.

---

### **Tyrgul, The Whispered Dark**

**Titles:** The Fearborn, The Heart-Tremor, The Coward’s God  
**Domain:** Fear, Panic, Instinct, and Darkness  
**Symbol:** A form of a snarling monster in black fog and red eyes

Tyrgul is not worshiped, but appeased.  
His name is carved into doorways, his effigy buried beneath thresholds  
to keep terror at bay.  
Yet every mortal who has ever trembled,  
every army that has ever broken,  
every heart that has ever faltered —  
has known his touch.

---

### **Chakar, The Everlasting Hunger**

**Titles:** The Blade God, The Vengeance Flame, The Silent Hunger  
**Domain:** Murder, Blood, Vengeance, and Violence  
**Symbol:** A bloodstained handprint on a black blade

His priests are assassins, his prayers are screams.  
He does not demand worship — only acts.  
Every murder is an offering, every betrayal a hymn.  
Even the innocent, when driven to vengeance,  
whisper his name without knowing why.

---

### **Bellala, The Mother of Sorcery**

**Titles:** Mistress of Magic, The Chaos Spark
**Domain:** Magic, Arcane Beasts, Creation, and Chaos  
**Symbol:** A spiral of silver flame encircling a single star

It was she who gave mortals the gift — and curse — of magic.  
To mages, she is both muse and warning:  
for magic obeys no law, and those who grasp it walk her path —  
bright, wild, and perilous.

Her laughter is heard in every spell gone awry,  
and her favor found in every miracle.

---

### **Asmodeus, The Horned One**

**Titles:** Lord of the Nine Hells, The Betrayed Flame, The Black Heart  
**Domain:** Sin, Power, Contracts, and Damnation  
**Symbol:** A burning heart impaled upon a horned sigil

The first son of deceit and death,  
he sits upon his throne of obsidian fire,  
ruling the Hells born from his own pain.  
He is the god of pride, of bargains, of ambition unchained.

Mortals fear him — yet many serve him willingly,  
for his promises are honeyed and his gifts divine.  
Even now, his heart beats once for every mortal sin,  
and the gods above tremble at its rhythm.

---

## **The Weary Dawn**



So the gods remain — distant, eternal, unseen except for a select few. 
They are not gone, only quiet.  
The world still bears their touch —  
in every sunrise, in every storm, in every act of love and cruelty alike.

And the priests who still study the _Testament_ whisper this prophecy:

> _“When mortals become as gods,  
> the Gate shall tremble once more.  
> The Prime Three shall rise from their silence,  
> and the Second Dawn shall burn away the old.”_

> _“And if the gods return — may they find us worthy.”_
